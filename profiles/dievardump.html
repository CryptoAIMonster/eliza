Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now actions are mostly seen as \"side effect\"  happening next to an answer sent by the agent.\r\nThere is no automated way to get the agent to call an action, interpret the result, and answer with that interpretation (which is what I would expect coming from OpenAI actions that are APIs that their runtime call and then get the result interpreted by the agent)\r\n\r\nRight now if I ask my agent: `what actions can you perform right now in the game?`\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"◎ Agent: I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\"] \r\n [\"◎ Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThere are two things that could be done. \r\nThe simple one would just have the action result override the answer from the agent (so in the previous example, the first text `I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?` wouldn't even be sent to the client).\r\n\r\nThe complicated one, would have do a second back-and forth with the agent, after getting the action result, in order to interpret that result.\r\n\r\nA) simple:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\", type: \"OVERRIDE_ANSWER\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"◎ Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n> here, simply adding a \"type\" (or any other field name) with value `OVERRIDE_ANSWER` to the action result, would tell the system to not send the agent answer, only the action result, to the client\r\n\r\nB) complicated:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ data: ['dice', 'roulette', 'blackjack'], type: \"ACTION_RESULT_INTERPRETATION\" }`\r\n3 - Agent request: `{ prompt: \"You were just asked 'what actions can you perform right now in the game?' which triggered the action 'LIST_GAME_ACTIONS' and the result was ['dice', 'roulette', 'blackjack']. Can you compose an answer knowing the question and the result?\" }`\r\n4- Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play dice, roulette and blackjack\"}`\r\n5 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"◎ Agent: I can play dice, roulette and blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n> here, there is a second message sent to the agent, telling it \"this is what happened, this is the result, can you interpret it?\". This would be done again through some \"type\"  (`ACTION_RESULT_INTERPRETATION`) on the action result, which would be some kind of \"operation\" to be done by the runtime.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nRight now as an alternative, I go with the \"simple\" solution, and at the client level, if there is any message with a `type: \"OVERRIDE_ANSWER\"` I remove all other messages from the returned messages.\r\n\r\nBut this forces me to do a fork of all the clients to add that filter, when it could be done earlier in the runtime / pipeline.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'm comparing \"actions\" to OpenAI actions where the agent detects that an action is possible from the prompt and a list of actions that are submitted (it also detects parameters)\r\nThen the agent call the API with those parameters\r\nThe API answers, and the agent interpret the result, create a constructed answer, and returns that answer.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to have a similar behavior for actions here\r\n","labels":[{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","description":"New feature or request"}],"comments":[{"author":"oguzserdar","body":"you could solve this at a more fundamental level by splitting agents into worker vs character types \r\n\r\nworker agents would be all business - they'd just execute actions and return results directly, perfect for stuff like `LIST_GAME_ACTIONS`. no personality, no fluff, just data.\r\n\r\ncharacter agents would be the chatty ones that interpret results and add narrative flair.\r\n\r\nyou could even take a temperature-based approach to balance between these - low temps giving you more worker-like behavior with just the facts, while higher temps let the agent be more expressive and narrative in their responses.\r\n\r\nthis split would naturally handle both your scenarios:\r\n- simple case: worker agents automatically override their response with action results  \r\n- complex case: character agents process action results and craft narrative responses\r\n\r\nbut if you want to move forward with your override/interpretation types approach first, that's totally workable too. you could handle it at the runtime level to avoid client mods.\r\n\r\nthe worker/character abstraction is there when you're ready to tackle the bigger architectural picture - it would make all of this stuff cleaner and more consistent in the long run"},{"author":"dievardump","body":"I do understand how I can go around this, but my goal here is to be able to have this feature integrated to my agents / characters, so they can automatically interpret actions results.\r\n\r\nThat's why I would like to make it a feature, not find a way to go around the fact it's not available."},{"author":"cristianrohr","body":"I support this petition\r\n"}]},{"number":798,"title":"actions examples selection does not select things properly","state":"CLOSED","created_at":"2024-12-02T22:31:56Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T11:23:49Z","body":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nthe function that selects examples of messages for actions, `composeActionExamples`, does a very poor job at selecting examples of actions for a maximum of actions available. usually very few actions really represented\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nAdd a few actions, console log the context sent to the llm model and see there aren't many actions represented in the examples\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe code should try to take \"at least one example per action\" or to have a bigger variety of action represented","labels":[{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","description":"Something isn't working"}],"comments":[]},{"number":795,"title":"Plugin system in character.plugins is not working","state":"CLOSED","created_at":"2024-12-02T19:33:49Z","updated_at":"2024-12-02T19:38:46Z","body":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nPlugin system in characters.plugins is not working.\r\n\r\n1) Loading the plugin\r\n\r\nWhen a character is loaded from a JSON, the code expects to find a list of path to plugins it can import.\r\n\r\n![Capture d’écran du 2024-12-02 18-57-33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a44cbb9-f175-4b62-b08a-0b6df787061a)\r\n\r\nHowever, the `validateCharacterConfig` expects the content of plugin to be an object.
