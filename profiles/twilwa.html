Here's the sequence:\r\n\r\n1. First call:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst responseMessages = await callback(responseContent);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Then the callback is passed to `processActions`:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait this.runtime.processActions(\r\n    memory,\r\n    responseMessages,\r\n    state,\r\n    callback  // <-- Same callback passed here\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Inside `processActions`, the action handler might call the callback again:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait action.handler(this, message, state, {}, callback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you could:\r\n\r\n1. Either modify the callback to be single-use:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts\r\nconst createCallback = () => {\r\n    let used = false;\r\n    return async (content: Content, files: any[]) => {\r\n        if (used) {\r\n            elizaLogger.warn(\"Callback already used, skipping\");\r\n            return [];\r\n        }\r\n        used = true;\r\n        // ... rest of callback logic ...\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst callback = createCallback();\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Or create separate callbacks for the initial response and actions:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts\r\nconst responseMessages = await callback(responseContent);\r\n\r\n// Create a new callback for actions that doesn't create memories\r\nconst actionCallback: HandlerCallback = async (content: Content, files: any[]) => {\r\n    try {\r\n        if (!content?.text.trim()) {\r\n            elizaLogger.warn(\"Skipping empty content\");\r\n            return [];\r\n        }\r\n        return await sendMessageInChunks(\r\n            message.channel as TextChannel,\r\n            content.text,\r\n            message.id,\r\n            files\r\n        );\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n        console.error(\"Error in action callback:\", error);\r\n        return [];\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nawait this.runtime.processActions(\r\n    memory,\r\n    responseMessages,\r\n    state,\r\n    actionCallback\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second approach might be better as it makes the distinction between response handling and action handling clearer.\r\n"},{"author":"odilitime","body":"isContinuation seems redundant, can’t the parentMessageId be enough?"}]},{"number":278,"title":"Linux dependency issues - discord voice client","state":"OPEN","created_at":"2024-11-12T23:20:38Z","updated_at":"2024-11-16T17:30:35Z","body":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nwhen starting the discord client, the bot fails\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nadd discord client to character.json, pnpm start --character\r\n<!-- Steps to reproduce the behavior. -->\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\ncharacter initializes successfully\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nsteps taken that resolve this issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt install node-gyp\r\n\r\npnpm add @octokit/core@3 -w\r\n\r\npnpm add @discordjs/opus@0.9.0 -w\r\n\r\npnpm add opusscript -w\r\n\r\npnpm add node-opus -w\r\n```\r\nthis results in the bot being able to join discord voice and transcribe audio without crashing and function normally in chat responses, general 'does it run off a fresh pull' tracking issue\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n","labels":[{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","description":"Something isn't working"}],"comments":[{"author":"sirkitree","body":"Try the following:\r\n1. downgrade to node v20 `nvm install 20 && nvm use 20`\r\n1. remove node modules and lock file `rm -rf node_modules && rm pnpm-lock.yaml`\r\n1. rerun install `pnpm i`"}]},{"number":275,"title":"advanced usage section of docs doesn't include instructions for memory management","state":"CLOSED","created_at":"2024-11-12T19:58:44Z","updated_at":"2024-12-14T07:31:24Z","body":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nThe docs section simply explains that it has the functionality, it doesn't explain how it works or how to use it\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!-- Steps to reproduce the behavior. -->\r\ngo to the docs and search memory\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\ninstructions on how to do memory management\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23ffc956-fd56-4d46-8608-a806efbb24f9)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80390c52-ad18-4de0-9744-6f994a439fb2)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/668bb2da-2f2f-46a2-ba5c-795585679573)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\nThe example I beleive is correct -- I was searching the docs for how to clear the memory db and rebuild it, and was unable to find the instructions","labels":[{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","description":"Something isn't working"},{"name":"documentation","color":"0075ca","description":"Improvements or additions to documentation"}],"comments":[{"author":"madjin","body":"![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c41c7aaf-39ee-4cc6-ad9e-0e73f01dae9c)\r\nthis is from the new docs, hopefully it is a worthy improvement"},{"author":"twilwa","body":"To some degree -- ideally, there's instructions about how I , as a developer or user, can CRUD memories.
