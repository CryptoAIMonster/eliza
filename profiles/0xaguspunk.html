If a plugin requires an initial setup such as setting up a wallet or a GOAT plugin (e.g adding Polymarket or Uniswap plugins) there is no way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nUpdate the GOAT plugin to get passed a `getSecrets` function for the specific character it is adding actions to. This allows GOAT to check the secrets/env variables and configure its plugins accordingly when being initialized.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements: This change allows developers to install GOAT plugins easily such as Polymarket, Uniswap and Coingecko. It also makes it easier to update the plugin to support multi-chain.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1.

Using Goat’s plugin system, developers can enable agents to:\r\n- Mint NFTs on Zora\r\n- Swap tokens on Uniswap\r\n- Place bets on Polymarket\r\nall with just a single line of code.\r\n\r\nThe framework supports multichain by either defining actions for a specific set of chains or dynamically selecting chains per action.\r\n\r\nThis concrete example simply enables transferring and checking the balance for USDC and ETH on the Base network.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?
