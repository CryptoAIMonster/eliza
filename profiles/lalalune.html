is a draft PR for the V2 branch.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely work in progress.\r\n\r\nHere are the objectives of V2:\r\n\r\n* Unified message bus and simplified clients\r\nWe'll be refactoring all clients to handle input and output only, with an event bus to hook in response handlers.\r\nClients will have dramatically less code, and agents will be able to send messages across clients. This will also enable autonomous agent to unify all input and outputs into a single stream of thought and action.\r\n\r\n* Unified agent wallet\r\nThe current wallet system reflects the way we use humans use wallets today, but the UX around network switching and wallet management is a pain. Instead, the agent will have a unified wallet, with access to all registered chains at once. No wallet switching, and tokens will all be handled by agents in a unified way.\r\n\r\n* Model Provider Registry\r\nThe current model provider system requires a pull request to core for every model provider. v2 will have a registry and override pattern so new code doesn't need to be added to core, and any provider can quickly override with a few lines of code to add integration without a pull request.\r\n\r\n* Extensible and generic core framework\r\nThe v1 is very opinionated about prompts, state and some features. v2 will be very extensible so you can create different kinds of agents and override state management and context composition. For advanced developers, this will make the framework far more powerful and flexible for different user cases.\r\n\r\n* Community plugins\r\nWe'll be moving community plugins out of core and adding requirements for plugin inclusion in core around test coverage, documentation and code maintenance and ownership.\r\n\r\n* Better secret management\r\nCurrently, secret management in .env and character files is risky, so considering better and more secure options for this\r\n\r\n* 100% Test Coverage\r\nv2 reflects what we want Eliza to be, and we feel that after these changes we should focus entirely on stability, security and cutting down on issues. We'll be aiming for 100% test coverage of core, adapters and primary components, and end-to-end tests for clients.","files":[{"path":".env.example","additions":13,"deletions":0},{"path":".github/workflows/ci.yaml","additions":1,"deletions":1},{"path":".github/workflows/integrationTests.yaml","additions":1,"deletions":1},{"path":"CONTRIBUTING.md","additions":1,"deletions":1},{"path":"README.md","additions":1,"deletions":1},{"path":"README_HE.md","additions":189,"deletions":0},{"path":"README_VI.md","additions":129,"deletions":0},{"path":"agent/package.json","additions":1,"deletions":14},{"path":"agent/src/index.ts","additions":47,"deletions":116},{"path":"characters/eternalai.character.json","additions":0,"deletions":394},{"path":"characters/tate.character.json","additions":0,"deletions":63},{"path":"docs/README.md","additions":4,"deletions":0},{"path":"docs/README_TH.md","additions":178,"deletions":0},{"path":"docs/package-lock.json","additions":0,"deletions":21360},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/README.md","additions":0,"deletions":32},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/eslint.config.mjs","additions":0,"deletions":3},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/package.json","additions":0,"deletions":19},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/src/actions/sampleAction.ts","additions":64,"deletions":70},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/src/evaluators/sampleEvalutor.ts","additions":0,"deletions":47},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/src/index.ts","additions":0,"deletions":8},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/src/plugins/samplePlugin.ts","additions":0,"deletions":17},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/src/providers/sampleProvider.ts","additions":0,"deletions":14},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/src/templates.ts","additions":0,"deletions":60},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/src/types.ts","additions":0,"deletions":51},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/tsconfig.json","additions":0,"deletions":13},{"path":"packages/_examples/plugin/tsup.config.ts","additions":0,"deletions":21},{"path":"packages/adapter-sqljs/.npmignore","additions":0,"deletions":6},{"path":"packages/adapter-sqljs/eslint.config.mjs","additions":0,"deletions":3},{"path":"packages/adapter-sqljs/package.json","additions":0,"deletions":24},{"path":"packages/adapter-sqljs/src/index.ts","additions":0,"deletions":799},{"path":"packages/adapter-sqljs/src/sqliteTables.ts","additions":0,"deletions":104},{"path":"packages/adapter-sqljs/src/types.ts","additions":0,"deletions":209},{"path":"packages/adapter-sqljs/tsconfig.json","additions":0,"deletions":11},{"path":"packages/adapter-sqljs/tsup.config.ts","additions":0,"deletions":20},{"path":"packages/adapter-supabase/.npmignore","additions":0,"deletions":6},{"path":"packages/adapter-supabase/config.toml","additions":0,"deletions":159},{"path":"packages/adapter-supabase/eslint.config.mjs","additions":0,"deletions":3},{"path":"packages/adapter-supabase/package.json","additions":0,"deletions":22},{"path":"packages/adapter-supabase/schema.sql","additions":0,"deletions":147},{"path":"packages/adapter-supabase/seed.sql","additions":0,"deletions":3},{"path":"packages/adapter-supabase/src/index.ts","additions":0,"deletions":683},{"path":"packages/adapter-supabase/tsconfig.json","additions":0,"deletions":10},{"path":"packages/adapter-supabase/tsup.config.ts","additions":0,"deletions":21},{"path":"packages/client-auto/.npmignore","additions":0,"deletions":6},{"path":"packages/client-auto/eslint.config.mjs","additions":0,"deletions":3},{"path":"packages/client-auto/package.json","additions":0,"deletions":27},{"path":"packages/client-auto/src/index.ts","additions":0,"deletions":30},{"path":"packages/client-auto/tsconfig.json","additions":0,"deletions":10},{"path":"packages/client-auto/tsup.config.ts","additions":0,"deletions":27},{"path":"packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts","additions":301,"deletions":128},{"path":"packages/client-discord/src/voice.ts","additions":1,"deletions":1},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/package.json","additions":0,"deletions":18},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/src/actions.ts","additions":0,"deletions":57},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/src/client.ts","additions":0,"deletions":228},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/src/index.ts","additions":0,"deletions":65},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts","additions":0,"deletions":285},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/src/memory.ts","additions":0,"deletions":107},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/src/post.ts","additions":0,"deletions":168},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/src/prompts.ts","additions":0,"deletions":88},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/src/types.ts","additions":0,"deletions":39},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/src/utils.ts","additions":0,"deletions":136},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/tsconfig.json","additions":0,"deletions":12},{"path":"packages/client-farcaster/tsup.config.ts","additions":0,"deletions":20},{"path":"packages/client-github/.npmignore","additions":0,"deletions":6},{"path":"packages/client-github/eslint.config.mjs","additions":0,"deletions":3},{"path":"packages/client-github/package.
