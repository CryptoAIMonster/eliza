While we have the infrastructure to create releases, we currently face challenges in ensuring that these releases are reliable and stable. The key issues are:\r\n\r\n- **Broken Test Suite:** Our automated tests are failing, which means we cannot confidently verify the stability and functionality of new code changes.\r\n- **Rapid Code Changes:** With many contributors and fast-moving code, it's difficult to track and integrate changes without introducing new bugs.\r\n- **Unreliable Releases:** Without a consistent and dependable release process, we risk distributing versions of our project that may not meet quality standards.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nTo overcome these challenges and establish a reliable release process, we propose the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Prioritize Fixing the Tests:**\r\n   - **Assess and Repair Tests:** Identify all failing tests and determine the causes. Fix broken tests to ensure they accurately reflect code functionality.\r\n   - **Community Involvement:** Encourage contributors to help fix tests by creating specific issues and assigning tasks.\r\n   - Testing issues can be found with the 'testing' label: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atesting\r\n\r\n2. **Establish Continuous Integration (CI):**\r\n   - **Automate Testing:** Set up a CI system to automatically run the test suite on every commit and pull request. For the most part this is already in place but only runs a basic test currently.\r\n   - **Enforce Test Passing:** Configure the CI to block merging of code that doesn't pass all tests, keeping the main branch stable. We currently have these running on every pull request, but it's not a blocking rule.\r\n\r\n3. **Implement a Branching Strategy:**\r\n   - **Use Feature Branches:** Have contributors work on separate branches for new features or fixes to isolate changes. For the most part this is happening already.\r\n   - **Adopt Release Branches:** Create dedicated branches for preparing releases, allowing for final testing and stabilization.\r\n\r\n4. **Define a Release Workflow:**\r\n   - **Release Types:** Clearly define different release types (e.g., alpha, beta, stable) and their purposes.\r\n   - **Semantic Versioning:** Use semantic versioning to communicate the nature of changes in each release.\r\n\r\n5. **Automate the Release Process:**\r\n   - **Automated Builds and Tagging:** Utilize tools to automate the building of releases and tagging of versions.\r\n   - **Generate Release Notes:** Automatically create release notes from commit messages to document changes. This is already in place and is updated when a tag is created through CI: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n6. **Establish Release Criteria:**\r\n   - **Set Clear Requirements:** Define what must be completed before a release (passing tests, code reviews, updated documentation).\r\n   - **Use a Release Checklist:** Implement a checklist to ensure all criteria are met before releasing.\r\n\r\n7. **Enhance Collaboration and Communication:**\r\n   - **Regular Updates:** Hold regular meetings or send updates to keep everyone informed about release progress.\r\n   - **Transparency:** Make the release roadmap and plans accessible to all contributors.\r\n\r\n8. **Implement Code Reviews and Quality Assurance:**\r\n   - **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require that all code changes are reviewed by at least one other contributor. We've talked about this in discord, but it hasn't been implemented as a rule yet.\r\n   - **Use Quality Tools:** Integrate static analysis and other quality assurance tools to catch issues early.\r\n\r\n9. **Plan for Different Release Channels:**\r\n   - **Stable Releases:** Provide thoroughly tested versions for general use.\r\n   - **Beta and Nightly Builds:** Offer less stable versions for testing new features and gathering feedback.\r\n\r\n10. **Monitor and Iterate:**\r\n    - **Collect Feedback:** After each release, gather input from users and contributors to identify improvements.\r\n    - **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly refine the release process based on feedback and performance metrics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Next Steps:**\r\n\r\n- **Immediate Actions:**\r\n  - **Fix the Test Suite:** Prioritize repairing all broken tests with the help of the community.\r\n  - **Set Up CI System:** Implement a continuous integration pipeline to automate testing and enforce code quality.\r\n\r\n- **Community Engagement:**\r\n  - **Communicate Plans:** Share this proposed solution with the community to align efforts and expectations.\r\n  - **Encourage Participation:** Invite contributors to take active roles in improving the testing and release processes.\r\n\r\n- **Documentation:**\r\n  - **Create Guidelines:** Document the release workflow, branching strategy, and contribution guidelines.\r\n  - **Provide Resources:** Offer tutorials or guides on how to work with the new processes and tools.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy taking these steps, we aim to build a robust and reliable release process that can handle rapid development while maintaining high-quality standards. This will not only improve the stability of our releases but also enhance collaboration within our community, ultimately leading to a better project for all users and contributors.","labels":[{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","description":"New feature or request"},{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672","description":"Extra attention is needed"},{"name":"Priority: High","color":"C97674","description":""},{"name":"infrastructure","color":"D42C01","description":""},{"name":"technical-debt","color":"487859","description":""}],"comments":[{"author":"yodamaster726","body":"this is a great idea.  we need to implement something that gets us to some continuous incremental stability.\r\ncreate some basic unit tests that run via github actions that notes a certain level of stability and only promote code to main if it's good.  also maybe have another dev-readme that maybe documents what all the functions are that are known to be stable, what is under development and what is in the pipeline.\r\nI know, most of this is already covered above - but just had to express my thoughts.

The goal is to establish a decentralized, automated registry system that allows bots to discover and authenticate each other. Once connected, the bots will communicate through a private back channel to exchange data and execute trades efficiently.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Features**:\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Registry System**: \r\n   - Each bot will register itself in a decentralized registry (e.g., using a lightweight P2P network or distributed ledger technology).\r\n   - Bots will periodically update the registry, checking for new bots or changes in status.\r\n   - The registry will include basic metadata to facilitate discovery, like cryptographic keys for authentication.\r\n   - Possibly services a particular bot provides to other bots that they could pay for in the future. (more on this later)\r\n\r\n2. **Private Back Channel Communication**:\r\n   - Implement a secure, real-time communication protocol, potentially leveraging WebRTC or a similar P2P technology.\r\n   - The protocol should ensure encrypted communication between bots, minimizing the risk of interception.\r\n   - Messages will be designed for minimal latency, suitable for rapid data exchange and trading negotiations.\r\n\r\n3. **Authentication and Security**:\r\n   - Use public-private key cryptography for bot authentication, ensuring only legitimate bots can participate in the network.\r\n   - Establish rules for trust and security, with mechanisms to handle untrusted or malicious bots.\r\n\r\n4. **Efficient Trading Protocol**:\r\n   - Design a protocol that allows bots to share and match order books in a streamlined manner.\r\n   - Ensure trades are executed quickly, with minimal delay, using predefined negotiation rules.\r\n   - Incorporate a fallback mechanism if communication or negotiation fails.\r\n\r\n**Benefits**:\r\n- **Speed**: A dedicated, private communication channel will facilitate faster data exchange compared to public platforms.\r\n- **Security**: Encrypted communication ensures that sensitive trading data remains confidential.\r\n- **Scalability**: The decentralized nature of the registry will support the growth of the network without becoming a bottleneck.\r\n\r\n**Considerations**:\r\n- The system should be resilient to potential attacks, like Sybil attacks, by incorporating strong authentication and trust mechanisms.\r\n- Developing a lightweight and efficient protocol is critical to minimize resource usage and latency.\r\n","labels":[{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","description":"New feature or request"}],"comments":[{"author":"lalalune","body":"Vehemently against private communication protocols between agents of any sort.

Module resolution and file extensions\n2. Incorrect usage of BigNumber constructor\n3. Incorrect usage of youtube-dl-exec\n4. Missing type definitions\n5. Node version compatibility\n\nHere are the suggested fixes:\n\n1. **Module Resolution Issues**\nThe TypeScript compiler is complaining about missing file extensions in imports when using Node16/NodeNext module resolution. You need to add `.js` extensions to relative imports. For example:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { Something } from '../core/types'\n\n// After\nimport { Something } from '../core/types.js'\n```\n\n2. **BigNumber Construction Issues**\nThere are multiple errors related to BigNumber construction from the bignumber.js package. The correct way to use it is:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nnew BigNumber(value)\n\n// After \nBigNumber(value) // or\nnew BigNumber.BigNumber(value)\n```\n\n3. **YouTube DL Exec Issues**\nThe youtube-dl-exec package is not being called correctly. You need to use its default export:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nyoutubedl(url, options)\n\n// After\nyoutubedl.default(url, options)\n```\n\n4. **PDF.js Types Issue**\nMissing type definitions for pdfjs-dist. Add the types to devDependencies:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/pdfjs-dist\": \"^2.10.378\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere are the specific files that need updates:\n\n1. Update tsconfig.json to handle module resolution:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node16\",\n    \"allowImportingTsExtensions\": true,\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Update CI workflow to use the correct Node version:\n\n```17:20:.github/workflows/ci.yaml\n            - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n              with:\n                  node-version: \"23\"\n                  cache: \"pnpm\"\n```\n\nChange to:\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n  with:\n    node-version: \"22\"\n    cache: \"pnpm\"\n```\n\n3. Add script to fix extensions:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfind src -type f -name \"*.ts\" -exec sed -i 's/from \"\\(\\.\\.?\\/.*\\)\"/from \"\\1.js\"/g' {} +\n```\n\n"},{"author":"sirkitree","body":"Got

Environment Testing\n\n**Local Testing**\n- Use a development environment that simulates Twitter's API responses[1]\n- Create test cases that mock Twitter interactions\n- Run your bot offline to verify basic functionality\n\n**API Testing Options**\n- Twitter's API offers no direct sandbox or test mode for posting[5]\n- Consider creating a private test account for development\n\n## Best Practices\n\n**Account Setup**\n- Create a separate development Twitter account specifically for testing\n- Keep the test account private to avoid public visibility\n- Use minimal followers/following to prevent unwanted interactions\n\n**Code Testing Methods**\n- Mock API calls in your code to simulate responses\n- Log bot actions instead of making actual posts\n- Test bot logic and processing separately from the actual posting mechanism\n\n## Bot Detection Testing\n\nBefore deploying, verify your bot behaves naturally by checking against common bot detection criteria:\n\n**Activity Patterns**\n- Maintain reasonable posting frequencies (avoid posting more than 10-15 times per day)[7]\n- Include varied content types, not just retweets\n- Add reasonable delays between actions\n\n**Account Setup**\n- Use a proper profile with complete information[7]\n- Avoid generic or automated-looking usernames\n- Include a proper profile picture and bio\n\nRemember that while testing, you must still comply with Twitter's terms of service and API usage guidelines[4].\n\nCitations:\n[1]
