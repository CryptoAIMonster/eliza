Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, maintaining comprehensive JSDoc documentation across our TypeScript codebase is a manual and time-consuming process. This leads to inconsistent documentation coverage and puts an unnecessary burden on developers. We need an automated solution that can help generate and maintain JSDoc comments while ensuring high quality and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nPropose a two-phase approach:\r\n\r\n1. Manual Documentation Phase:\r\n   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript files\r\n   - Include documentation for functions, classes, interfaces, and other code blocks\r\n\r\n2. Automation Implementation:\r\n   - Develop an LLM-based automation solution for generating JSDoc comments\r\n   - Integrate the automation into our CI/CD pipeline (like when a PR for a new feat is merged)\r\n   - Create a manual trigger mechanism for the automation process\r\n\r\n**Create a GitHub Actions workflow/AI agent that:**\r\n\r\n1. Automated Documentation Generation:\r\n   - Triggers on demand (via workflow_dispatch) or when specific files change\r\n   - Scans TypeScript files that lack JSDoc documentation\r\n   - Uses an AI service (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate contextually accurate JSDoc comments\r\n   - Maintains existing JSDoc comments and only adds missing ones\r\n\r\n2. Quality Control:\r\n   - Follows our existing JSDoc standards and TypeDoc configuration\r\n   - Validates generated comments for completeness and accuracy\r\n   - Ensures proper documentation of parameters, return types, and function descriptions\r\n\r\n3. Pull Request Management:\r\n   - Creates a new branch for documentation updates\r\n   - Generates a pull request with the changes\r\n   - Adds appropriate labels (e.g., 'documentation', 'automated')\r\n   - Includes a detailed PR description explaining the changes\r\n   - Assigns relevant reviewers\r\n\r\n4. Configuration:\r\n   - Allows customization of AI prompt templates\r\n   - Provides options to include/exclude specific files or directories\r\n   - Configurable commit message and PR templates\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Manual documentation enforcement through PR checks\r\n2. Using existing JSDoc generation tools like https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc\r\n3. Implementing stricter code review policies for documentation\r\n4. Creating documentation sprints for batch updates\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRequired Permissions and Secrets:\r\n- GitHub token with PR creation permissions\r\n- AI service API key (e.g., OpenAI)\r\n- Repository write access for branch creation\r\n\r\n### Additional Motivation\r\n\r\nThis could be a proof of concept AI junior dev Karpathy talks about\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c3c68f-d85a-414c-a26f-231bd6ecb831)\r\n\r\n","labels":[{"name":"documentation","color":"0075ca","description":"Improvements or additions to documentation"},{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","description":"New feature or request"}],"comments":[{"author":"0xbuild-oss","body":"I can pick this up.
