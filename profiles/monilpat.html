Risks\r\n\r\n- **Low**: The changes primarily affect the installation process and dependency management. There is a risk of potential issues if the frozen lock file is not respected, which could lead to inconsistent dependency versions across environments.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the installation commands across various files to ensure that the `pnpm install` command uses the `--frozen-lockfile` option. This prevents the lock file from being incorrectly updated during installations. Additionally, an explicit update script has been added to allow updates without the frozen lock file option. We updated the .npmrc default to set frozen-lockfile=true and in order to update the lockfile when you add a new dependency in your package.json or bump a version in your package.json you need to explicitly call pnpm i --no-frozen-lockfile \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Improvements**: This change improves the dependency management process by enforcing the use of a consistent lock file during installations.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

This is a good first step to prevent unduly updated lockfiles :) "},{"author":"jzvikart","body":"Hey @monilpat, I've already started working on this during weekend myself. See this branch: [jure/fix-workflows-and-docs](https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/tree/jure/fix-workflows-and-docs). I even went so far to try to update Chinese etc. READMEs, which is of course complete nonsense since I don't even understand what is written there. Furthermore, there are scripts that use `pnpm install` that I cannot really test, and since it they are undocumented it's impossible to tell if they should be changed or not.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had a thought to update all references to `pnpm install`, but I changed my mind because it's not a black/white decision. People need to understand how lockfiles work, and if they are not using them properly it is not our ability (or responsibility) to educate them. The issues we're seeing today with lockfiles are the result of (1) `npm` / `pnpm`'s design decision (or rather, a change of), and (2) carelesness.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution therefore boils down to PR reviewers. In particular:\r\n- The `main` and `develop` branches should always be \"stable\", i.e. having passing tests\r\n- Whenever a PR introduces a change that causes tests to fail, it should not be merged until the cause of failure is established and corrected.\r\n\r\nThat said, the tests can fail for more than lockfile being out of sync, and we should probably focus on making them work in a reliable way. One of key issues is that our tests depend on external things such as OpenAI and API keys. I would recommend adding a separate smoke test just for OpenAI (a simple `curl` command)."},{"author":"jzvikart","body":"As agreed, adding `frozen-lockfile=true` to `.npmrc` is probably the best

Verify the implementation of error-handling and security measures (e.g., webhook secret validation).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps:\r\n1. **Testing Webhook Creation**:\r\n   - Use a public testing service like [[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)](https://webhook.site) to create a webhook URL.\r\n   - Replace the `notificationUri` field in the example code with the generated URL.\r\n   - Run the `CREATE_WEBHOOK` action and validate the response.\r\n\r\n2. **Testing Webhook Listing**:\r\n   - Trigger the `webhookProvider` action to fetch and log existing webhooks.\r\n   - Cross-check the response data with Coinbase's CDP portal to ensure consistency.\r\n\r\n3. **Error Scenarios**:\r\n   - Test webhook creation with invalid inputs (e.g., invalid network ID or event type) and confirm appropriate error responses.\r\n\r\n4. **Security Validation**:\r\n   - Verify the webhook secret is securely stored and not exposed in logs or public code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes:\r\n- Deploy as part of the Eliza core runtime update.\r\n- Ensure the necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, webhook secret) are set in production.\r\n- Include retry logic in case of intermittent service failures during webhook registration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Database Changes:\r\n- **None**: This plugin does not introduce database dependencies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deployment Instructions:\r\n1. Set up the Coinbase API key file in a secure environment.\r\n2. Configure `runtime.character.settings.secrets` with the webhook secret.\r\n3. Verify the webhook functionality using test and production environments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# [Discord](https://discord.gg/elizaos)

Additionally:\r\n1. A reusable utility function `getWalletDetails` is introduced to:\r\n   - Fetch wallet balances.\r\n   - Retrieve recent wallet transactions.\r\n   - Format and return this data.\r\n2.

Review the `getWalletDetails` function in `utils.ts` for implementation details.\r\n2. Check the updated `massPayoutProvider`, `tradeProvider`, and `chargeProvider` for integration of wallet details.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure the Coinbase SDK with a valid wallet and network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet).\r\n2. Call the following providers:\r\n   - `massPayoutProvider.get()`\r\n   - `tradeProvider.get()`\r\n   - `chargeProvider.get()`\r\n3. Verify:\r\n   - Balances include correct asset types and amounts.\r\n   - Transactions include valid timestamps, asset types, statuses, and URLs.\r\n   - Original provider data (e.g., CSV records, charges, or trades) remains unaffected.\r\n4. Test scenarios with:\r\n   - Wallets containing no balances or transactions.\r\n   - Wallets with multiple assets.\r\n5.

For instance, action values like `NONE` are inconsistently quoted, causing JSON parsing errors that disrupt program logic. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces provider-specific handlers within `generateObject`, allowing standardized JSON parsing for each model type and reducing the need for custom error-handling code.

This centralizes parsing and prepares for structured output where supported.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n- Run unit tests on `generateObject` to confirm JSON parsing accuracy with new handlers.\r\n- Test across different AI model providers, especially OpenAI, to ensure JSON responses adhere to expected formats.\r\n- Check logs for consistent error handling and retry logic.\r\n\r\n","files":[{"path":".gitignore","additions":0,"deletions":1},{"path":"package.json","additions":2,"deletions":1},{"path":"packages/core/package.json","additions":1,"deletions":0},{"path":"packages/core/src/generation.ts","additions":371,"deletions":1},{"path":"packages/core/src/tests/generation.test.ts","additions":166,"deletions":0},{"path":"pnpm-lock.yaml","additions":11,"deletions":2}],"reviews":[{"author":"jkbrooks","state":"APPROVED","body":"LGTM"}],"comments":[]},{"number":282,"title":"[BE] Add script to dump all file contents into one file to interact with LLMs easier ","state":"CLOSED","merged":false,"created_at":"2024-11-13T02:39:48Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T05:35:55Z","body":"# Relates to:\r\n\r\nBetter Engineering work as trying to contribute most effectively to the codebase using LLMs to consult and debug. \r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis makes it trivial to work with LLMs for code gen / debugging by copy and pasting the contents of all_files_contents.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\nIn order to make dev efficiency higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nRun script \r\n\r\n./dump_file_contents.sh folder_to_exclude folder_exclude \r\n\r\nExample\r\n./dump_file_contents.sh packages .github .gitignore\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb622c73-5250-4e6c-be85-df00bc7dc890\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1056\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-12 at 6 37 16 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d07169e-7d9f-46ba-adbb-b8de8e19cec5\">\r\n\r\n\r\n","files":[{"path":".gitignore","additions":3,"deletions":1},{"path":"dump_file_contents.sh","additions":35,"deletions":0}],"reviews":[],"comments":[{"author":"madjin","body":"thoughtful but there's already some great existing tools for this too:\r\n- https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/code2prompt\r\n- https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix"},{"author":"monilpat","body":"Thanks for the pointer! @madjin appreciate it!
