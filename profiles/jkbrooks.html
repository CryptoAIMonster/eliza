The goal is to create a more flexible and extensible architecture that can accommodate various blockchain integrations and trading strategies.\r\n\r\n**Goals:**\r\n\r\n* Eliminate redundancy and inconsistency between the plugins for individual chains and Coinbase SDK.\r\n* Establish a unified trading interface that can be implemented by different blockchain/exchange adapters.\r\n* Implement a centralized data source or normalization layer for price and market data.\r\n* Develop a unified wallet management system for different blockchain/exchange wallets.\r\n* Support diverse trading strategies beyond simple token swaps (e.g., swing trading, day trading).\r\n* Ensure scalability and maintainability of the trading system as new integrations are added.\r\n\r\n**Decision Points:**\r\n\r\n* **DP1: Coinbase SDK Focus vs. Multi-SDK Support:**\r\n    * **Option A: Prioritize Coinbase SDK:** Focus primarily on the Coinbase SDK and contribute back to its development to enhance its functionality and multi-chain support.  This would involve working closely with the Coinbase team and aligning development efforts.\r\n    * **Option B: Create a Training Module/Adapter System:** Develop a training module or adapter system that allows Eliza to seamlessly integrate with different SDKs (Coinbase, Solana Web3.js, etc.). This would provide greater flexibility but require more upfront development effort.  This approach requires designing abstract interfaces for trading, data retrieval, and wallet management.\r\n    * **Option C: Hybrid Approach:**  Start with a focus on the Coinbase SDK for its existing multi-chain support, but design the system with the future flexibility to add other SDKs via an adapter pattern.  This would balance immediate needs with long-term extensibility.\r\n\r\n* **DP2: Centralized vs. Decentralized Data Management:**\r\n    * **Option A: Centralized Data Source:** Choose a single, reliable data provider for price and market data.  This simplifies data management but creates a single point of failure.\r\n    * **Option B: Decentralized Data Aggregation:**  Aggregate data from multiple sources (Coinbase, Jupiter, Birdeye, etc.) and implement a normalization layer to handle discrepancies and ensure data consistency. This approach is more robust but increases complexity.\r\n\r\n* **DP3: Unified Wallet Management Strategy:**\r\n    * **Option A: Abstract Wallet Interface:**  Develop an abstract wallet interface that can be implemented by different wallet providers (Solana, Coinbase, etc.).  This allows for flexibility in wallet selection but requires careful design.\r\n    * **Option B:  Custom Wallet Management Service:** Create a custom wallet management service within Eliza that interacts directly with different wallet APIs.  This provides more control but increases development effort.\r\n\r\n* **DP4: Scope of Trading Strategies:**\r\n    * **Option A:  Focus on Long-Term Holding:** Initially, limit support to long-term buy-and-hold strategies, simplifying the trust engine and trade management.\r\n    * **Option B:  Support Arbitrary Trading:** Implement support for a wider range of trading strategies (swing trading, day trading, etc.) from the outset.  This increases complexity but provides greater flexibility.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Sub-Tickets (Initial List - To be refined):**\r\n\r\n* **ST1: Design Abstract Trading Interface:** Design a unified trading interface that can be implemented by different blockchain/exchange adapters.\r\n* **ST2: Implement Coinbase Adapter:** Create a Coinbase adapter that implements the abstract trading interface, handling trade execution, data retrieval, and wallet management.\r\n* **ST3: Implement Solana Adapter:** Create a Solana adapter that implements the abstract trading interface.\r\n* **ST4: Develop Data Normalization Layer (if needed):** If using multiple data sources, create a data normalization layer to ensure data consistency.\r\n* **ST5: Implement Unified Wallet Management System:**  Develop a unified wallet management system that supports multiple blockchain/exchange wallets.\r\n* **ST6: Implement Position Tracking:**  Create a system for tracking open positions and trade history.\r\n* **ST7: Enhance Trust Engine for Arbitrary Trading:** Modify the trust engine to support different trade types, timeframes, and performance metrics.\r\n* **ST8: Develop Backtesting Framework:** Implement a backtesting framework for evaluating trading strategies.\r\n* **ST9: Implement Automated Trading Engine:** Develop an automated trading engine.\r\n* **ST10: Testing and Validation:**  Develop a comprehensive test suite for the refactored trading system, covering different adapters, data sources, and trading scenarios.\r\n* **ST11: Documentation and Examples:**  Update the documentation to reflect the changes in the trading system architecture and provide examples of using different adapters and strategies.\r\n\r\n**Next Steps:**\r\n\r\n* Conduct thorough research and analysis to inform decisions on each decision point.\r\n* Prioritize sub-tickets based on chosen architecture and strategic goals.\r\n* Assign sub-tickets to developers and create a development roadmap.\r\n* Regularly review progress and update this epic ticket accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis epic provides a roadmap for refactoring Eliza's trading system to achieve multi-chain compatibility and support more advanced trading strategies. Careful consideration of the decision points and collaborative development of the sub-tickets will result in a more robust, scalable, and versatile trading platform for Eliza agents.","labels":[{"name":"V2","color":"1670F6","description":"Eliza 0.2.0"}],"comments":[]},{"number":663,"title":"Failed codecov run","state":"CLOSED","created_at":"2024-11-29T02:37:13Z","updated_at":"2024-11-29T22:33:23Z","body":"We need to fix https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/actions/runs/12075056047 which appears related to \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/608 and might get fixed with https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/659 @snobbee @monilpat @pgoos ","labels":[{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","description":"Something isn't working"}],"comments":[{"author":"monilpat","body":"@jkbrooks Thanks so much for flagging!

This distributed development model is a strength, but it also creates a challenge: managing code divergence and ensuring interoperability across the growing Eliza ecosystem. This ticket aims to establish a community-driven plan for addressing this challenge, fostering collaboration, and maximizing code reuse while allowing for customization and innovation within individual forks.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\n* **Multiple Diverging Forks:** As more developers fork Eliza, the ecosystem will naturally fragment into various specialized implementations.\r\n* **Increased Merge Complexity:** Merging changes between forks, or between forks and the main repository, will become increasingly complex and error-prone as divergence increases.\r\n* **Maintenance Overhead:**  Each fork incurs its own maintenance burden, requiring developers to track upstream changes, resolve merge conflicts, and ensure compatibility.\r\n* **Duplication of Effort and Reinventing the Wheel:** Developers in different forks might unknowingly duplicate efforts by re-implementing similar features.\r\n* **Reduced Interoperability:**  Divergence can lead to reduced interoperability between different Eliza agents or implementations.\r\n\r\n**Goals:**\r\n\r\n* **Minimize Divergence (Where Feasible):** Encourage practices that minimize unnecessary code divergence across forks.\r\n* **Facilitate Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:** Foster communication and collaboration between maintainers of different forks and the core Eliza team.\r\n* **Streamline Merging and Integration:** Establish best practices and potentially develop tools for efficiently merging changes between forks and the main repository.\r\n* **Maximize Code Reuse:**  Promote modular design and encourage the development of reusable plugins and components that can be shared across the ecosystem.\r\n* **Maintain Core Eliza Stability:**  Ensure that core Eliza functionality remains stable and reliable while allowing for innovation and customization within forks.\r\n\r\n**Near-Term Plan (Community-Driven):**\r\n\r\n1. **Fork Registry (Website or GitHub Page):** Create a central registry of known Eliza forks. This registry could include project descriptions, contact information for maintainers, and links to the forked repositories.  This facilitates discovery and collaboration.\r\n\r\n2. **Communication Channels (Discord, Forum):**  Establish dedicated communication channels (e.g., a Discord server, a forum category) for discussing fork management, sharing best practices, and coordinating development efforts.\r\n\r\n3. **Modularization and Plugin Development:**  Encourage developers to refactor fork-specific code into modular plugins or extensions that can be easily shared and integrated with other Eliza implementations.\r\n\r\n4. **Standardized Plugin Interface:**  Develop and document a clear, standardized interface for creating Eliza plugins.  This promotes interoperability and simplifies plugin integration.\r\n\r\n5. **Shared Test Suite:**  Create a shared test suite that covers core Eliza functionality.  Encourage fork maintainers to incorporate this test suite into their continuous integration pipelines to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n6. **Documentation:**  Create documentation and tutorials on best practices for forking Eliza, managing divergence, and contributing back to the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Future Considerations (Speculative):**\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Merging Tools:**  Explore and potentially develop automated merging tools that can help resolve conflicts and integrate changes between forks more efficiently.\r\n2. **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) Workflows:** Investigate whether alternative version control systems or workflows (like Git submodules or subtree merging) could facilitate managing multiple forks.\r\n3. **Inter-Agent Communication Protocol:** If AI-driven code synchronization is a long-term goal, develop a protocol or language for communication between agents managing different forks.\r\n4. **Federated Learning for Agents:**  Explore the potential of federated learning techniques, allowing agents in different forks to collaboratively train and improve shared models without directly exchanging sensitive data.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n\r\n* A community-driven plan is established and documented for managing divergence across the Eliza ecosystem.\r\n* The plan includes specific steps for facilitating collaboration, streamlining merging, maximizing code reuse, and maintaining core Eliza stability.\r\n* The plan is actively communicated and promoted within the Eliza community.\r\n* Tools and resources (fork registry, communication channels, shared test suite) are created to support the plan's implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ticket expands the scope to address the broader challenge of managing multiple forks within the Eliza ecosystem. The key shift is towards a community-driven approach, emphasizing collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the development of shared resources and standards. This fosters a more vibrant and sustainable ecosystem while allowing individual forks the flexibility to innovate and adapt Eliza to their specific needs.","labels":[{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","description":"New feature or request"}],"comments":[{"author":"pukadev","body":"ill add a lot more later but these prompts really help.
