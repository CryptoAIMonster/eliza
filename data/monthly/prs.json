    "title": "Opacity Verifiable Interference zkTLS Plugin",
    "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

    "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

Potential risks include:\r\n\r\n- **Dependency Resolution Changes:** Updates might lead to different versions of dependencies being installed, which could introduce unforeseen issues.\r\n\r\n- **Build or Runtime Errors:** If updated dependencies have breaking changes, they might cause build failures or runtime errors.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file by running `pnpm install -r --no-frozen-lockfile`. This command installs dependencies recursively across all workspaces and refreshes the lockfile to reflect any changes in dependencies.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Updates:** This is a non-breaking change that updates the lockfile to ensure it accurately represents the current state of dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nUpdating the lockfile ensures that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the project can be built and run consistently across different environments.

The parts involving other modules will be submitted later. For now, please review this plugin first.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nWhat does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin for fetching Twitter data reliably and efficiently. It addresses the limitations of using personal Twitter accounts for scraping, such as rate limits and account bans, by leveraging a proven solution that has already processed millions of requests on Apify.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change is this?\r\n<!-- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) Improvements (misc. changes to existing features) Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality) Updates (new versions of included code) -->\r\nFeatures: Adds a new plugin for Twitter data fetching.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. --><!-- ## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work? -->\r\nAI agents require large amounts of high-quality, timely data to function effectively. The intelligence of an AI agent depends on two key factors:\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the underlying AI model.\r\n\r\nThe quality, quantity, and timeliness of the data it processes.\r\n\r\nUsing personal Twitter accounts for scraping data poses significant risks, including account bans and rate limits. This plugin provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution for fetching Twitter data, which has already been validated through millions of executions on Apify.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am offering free usage credits to help developers get started quickly and contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed?\r\nI added a new environment variable and have updated the documentation in all relevant languages. I also explained the purpose of this variable.\r\nTWITTER_API_IO_KEY=\r\n#A third-party Twitter API key for data retrieval. This shared key is for testing only - get your personal key at https://twitterapi.io to avoid QPS limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\nIn the `src/tests` directory under my newly added component folder, you can find all the unit tests for the APIs. I ran the command `pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test` and confirmed that all unit tests passed successfully.\r\n\r\nDetailed testing steps\r\n`pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test`\r\n\r\nVerify that the plugin can fetch Twitter data without login.\r\n\r\nTest the plugin's performance under high concurrency.\r\n\r\nEnsure the plugin handles rate limits and errors gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscord username: [kaitoeasyapi]\r\nTwitter: [kaitoEasyApi](https://x.com/kaitoEasyApi)\r\nApify Twitter Actor: https://apify.com/kaitoeasyapi/twitter-x-data-tweet-scraper-pay-per-result-cheapest\r\n\r\n",

It modifies the tokenizer logic to handle the specific tokenization patterns and configurations required for the `o1` model.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nIncluding support for the `o1` model aligns with expanding the capabilities of `js-tiktoken` to handle the latest OpenAI models. This ensures broader usability and aligns with ongoing support for new model releases.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- My changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n- Updated README to include details on `o1` model support.\r\n- Added an entry to the changelog to document the feature addition.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing changes in the tokenizer logic in `src/tokenizer.js` and the associated test cases in `tests/tokenizer.test.js`.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository and check out the branch containing this PR.\r\n2. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date.\r\n3. Execute tests with `npm test` and verify that all test cases pass.\r\n4. Manually test by tokenizing examples specific to the `o1` model and comparing output against expected results.\r\n\r\nExample manual test:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { encode } = require('js-tiktoken');\r\nconst model = 'o1';\r\nconst input = 'Hello, this is a test.';\r\nconsole.log(encode(input, model));\r\n",

Which on subsequent messages, would trigger the callback to respond to the same message multiple times.\r\n\r\nWhere the continue action is meant for a natural flow of thoughts to keep generating, on normal back and forth convo's it would duplicate response.\r\n\r\nFix below now stops that as it takes into consideration its own message it just responded to, and how it framed to either not respond again, or continue a thought as it was intended.\r\n\r\n---TESTING Screen Record---\r\n1st section shows a previous double response, which is triggered by the question the agent asked to the user, which in turn triggers a double response on the next reply from the user\r\n\r\n2nd section shows continue being triggered as normal, but not triggering another response in the handler callback since it already responded. This will still allow continue to allow the agent to \"continue\" a thought it had as it was intended, also, per the examples.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ed92c8f-dc99-4c3b-95fc-9c0052f56197\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nninja_dev\r\n",

Review the plugin's architecture in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/index.ts`\r\n2. Check the market making strategy implementation in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/strategies/simple-market-making.ts`\r\n3. Review type definitions and configuration interface in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/types.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`\r\n2. Configure Hummingbot instance details in your character config:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"plugins\": [\"@eliza/plugin-hummingbot\"],\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"HUMMINGBOT_CONFIG\": {\r\n      \"instance\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"http://localhost:15888\",\r\n        \"apiKey\": \"your-api-key\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates the **FereAI APIs** using the `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK` module and update the **FerePro Plugin**, enhancing functionality to handle `ChatResponse` objects with better granularity. The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the integration of the `fereai-provider` in the `package.json` and the configuration of the required environment variables. Then, examine the updates made to `packages/core/src/generation.ts`, `packages/core/src/models.ts`, `packages/core/src/types.ts` and the `agent/src/index.ts` handlers under API configurations to understand the response handling.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables**:  \r\n   - Ensure that `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` are correctly set in the environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Run `pnpm add` to install the new `fereai-provider` module.\r\n\r\n3. **Run Unit Tests**:  \r\n   - Execute the `fereai-provider` test suite to verify that all existing and new tests pass successfully.\r\n   - For `fereai-provider` tests, refer to the [fereai-provider tests](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider/blob/main/packages/fereai/src/fereai.test.ts).\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing**:  \r\n   - Interact with the chatbot to ensure that responses are handled correctly and that the integration with FereAI APIs functions as expected using `fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Monitor logs to confirm that structured logging is operational and that no errors related to the new integration occur.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

    "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, we observed issues with aixbt, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Reclaim as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Reclaim is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nUpdates \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating **Reclaim** as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zero-knowledge proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-reclaim README.\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Proof Verification Example\r\nBelow is a screenshot showcasing the generated proof and its verification process:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 39 17 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c64b01-47b1-4ece-8624-9b65e7624f66\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 31 20 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41d675e-9249-4c46-9f12-396f02b7d8b2\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure the following environment variables (generated from the [Reclaim Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)):\r\n```\r\n# Reclaim Protocol\r\nRECLAIM_APP_ID= # Reclaim App ID\r\nRECLAIM_APP_SECRET= # Reclaim App Secret\r\n\r\n# Verifiable Inference Configuration\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_ENABLED=true # Set to true to enable verifiable inference\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=reclaim # Options: reclaim, opacity (soon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run a character using the command:\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"`\r\n\r\n3. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n4. Interact with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- Automated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n- No database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n--> Gajesh#0000\r\n",

    "body": "# Risks\r\nLow. Existing users who relied on Deepgram by default will still see no change unless they explicitly define a new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`. Fallback logic preserves original behavior (Deepgram → OpenAI → Local).\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- **Adds** an optional `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` setting (`deepgram`, `openai`, or `local`) with fallback logic.  \r\n  - If not set, old behavior remains: Deepgram → OpenAI → Local.\r\n- **Moves** Twitter Spaces plugins from `agent-twitter-client` into this repo for better flexibility and less friction in plugin development.\r\n- **Introduces** an AI-driven Twitter Spaces flow:\r\n  1. **Automatic** Space launch decisions (random chance, business hours, cooldown intervals).\r\n  2. **Multi-speaker** logic with queue management (`maxSpeakers`).\r\n  3. GPT-based filler/idle messages, optional STT/TTS bridging, local audio recording.\r\n  4. Graceful shutdown and cooldown for repeated Spaces.\r\n\r\n### Transcription Service Changes\r\n- We introduced a new **`TranscriptionProvider` enum** (`Deepgram`, `OpenAI`, or `Local`) to replace string flags.\r\n- In `initialize()`, the **provider is chosen in this order**:\r\n  1. `character.settings.transcription` (if the API keys exist),\r\n  2. `.env` (`TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`),\r\n  3. Old fallback logic (Deepgram → OpenAI → Local) if neither is configured.\r\n- For example, in your `character.json`, you can specify:\r\n  ```json5\r\n  {\r\n    // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n      \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  If you have `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set, the service will use Deepgram; otherwise it continues to the next check.\r\n- `processQueue()` uses a `switch` on `this.transcriptionProvider` to pick the final method (`transcribeWithDeepgram`, `transcribeWithOpenAI`, or `transcribeLocally`).\r\n\r\n## Flow Recap\r\n1. **Periodic Check**  \r\n   - If no Space is running, possibly launch one by `shouldLaunchSpace()` (random chance, business hours, cooldown).  \r\n   - If a Space is running, `manageCurrentSpace()` handles speaker timeouts, occupancy updates, queue acceptance, etc.\r\n\r\n2. **Space Creation**  \r\n   - Generates a `SpaceConfig` (topics from config or GPT).  \r\n   - Attaches plugins: audio recording, STT/TTS, idle monitor, etc.  \r\n   - Hooks into `speakerRequest`, `occupancyUpdate`, `idleTimeout`, etc.\r\n\r\n3. **Speaker Logic**  \r\n   - Maintains an `activeSpeakers` array + a queue if at capacity (`maxSpeakers`).  \r\n   - Enforces `speakerMaxDurationMs` per speaker.  \r\n   - If a speaker is removed, accept next in queue if available.\r\n\r\n4. **Stopping**  \r\n   - `stopSpace()` finalizes the Space, logs completion, clears states, etc.  \r\n   - Resumes periodic checks at a slower interval until the next launch is decided.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### A) `.env` / Environment Variables\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Transcription Provider\r\nTRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=         # Default is local (possible values: deepgram, openai, local)\r\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\r\nDEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### B) `character.json` → `\"twitterSpaces\"` Field\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n  }\r\n  \"twitterSpaces\": {\r\n    \"maxSpeakers\": 2,\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"Blockchain Trends\",\r\n      \"AI Innovations\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"typicalDurationMinutes\": 45,\r\n    \"idleKickTimeoutMs\": 300000,\r\n    \"minIntervalBetweenSpacesMinutes\": 60,\r\n    \"businessHoursOnly\": true,\r\n    \"randomChance\": 0.3,\r\n    \"enableIdleMonitor\": true,\r\n    \"enableSttTts\": true,\r\n    \"enableRecording\": false,\r\n    \"voiceId\": \"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\",\r\n    \"sttLanguage\": \"en\",\r\n    \"gptModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\r\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful AI co-host assistant.\",\r\n    \"speakerMaxDurationMs\": 240000\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **`maxSpeakers`**: number of concurrent speakers allowed.\r\n- **`topics`**: if none are provided, GPT generates them dynamically.\r\n- **`randomChance`**: probability for each check cycle to spawn a new Space.\r\n- **`speakerMaxDurationMs`**: maximum time each speaker can speak before removal.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Features** (new Twitter Spaces integration and optional transcription provider).\r\n- **Improvements** (unified plugin development, more config options, fallback logic maintained).\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, minimal. We must mention:\r\n- The new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (optional).\r\n- The new `twitterSpaces` config section in `character.json`.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Check `transcription.service.ts` to review how it resolves conflicts by prioritizing character settings, then `.env`, then old fallback.\r\n- Check new or relocated Twitter Spaces integration files for the Space lifecycle (launch, speaker management, idle detection, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Define `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (or leave it empty to keep old fallback).\r\n2. Provide valid API keys if choosing `deepgram` or `openai`.\r\n3. Define `twitterSpaces.randomChance` in the character JSON to `1` (for a 100% rate of starting a space).\r\n4. Run the agent; verify that Spaces launch automatically, respect the chosen transcription provider, and handle multi-speaker logic as expected.\r\n\r\nNo special database migrations are needed. Basic local runs and logs confirm correct functioning.\r\n\r\n# Future Improvements\r\n\r\n- **More robust decision logic** for accepting speakers, switching, and timeouts.  \r\n- **Realtime API plugin** for smoother, on-the-fly conversation handling.  \r\n- **Solo Broadcast Mode**: launch Spaces focused on a single host monologue with no external speakers.  \r\n- **True VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** to detect when a speaker finishes talking, instead of relying on manual mute/unmute cues.  \r\n- **Advanced scheduling triggers** (e.g., event-based or calendar-based).  \r\n- **Analytics & insights** for post-Space summaries or usage metrics.\r\n\r\n---",

I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.  I know there is alot of interest in the memory system as well so as part of the core it should be as clear as possible IMHO."

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nNo\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n**Low**\r\n- Adjustments to database queries improve performance by moving sorting and limiting logic to the database side.\r\n- Even though this change adds improvements to the Postgres adapter and required a change in the global `IDatabaseAdapter`, other database adapters are still working because the `limit` parameter is optional.\r\n- Other plugins relying on the `getMemoriesByRoomIds` function can opt into the `limit` functionality, but it is not necessary.\r\n- No breaking changes introduced.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR improves the performance of memory-fetching functionality by:\r\n- Moving sorting and slicing logic from the application layer to the database layer.\r\n- Adding an optional `limit` parameter to restrict the number of results fetched from the database.\r\n- Adjusting the runtime logic to leverage the new database query functionality.\r\n\r\n## Why was this change made?\r\nIn our database with **60,000 memories**, fetching memories by room IDs took **40 seconds**, significantly affecting the performance of the agent. After applying this fix, the query execution time dropped to just **0.02 seconds**. This improvement was observed using Supabase analytics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Changes to existing functionality to improve database query performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts` to understand how sorting and limiting were implemented in the database query.\r\n- Look at the adjusted runtime logic in `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` for the integration of the `limit` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Ensure all existing tests for memory fetching pass.\r\n2. Manually test the memory-fetching feature by:\r\n   - Querying with and without the `limit` parameter.\r\n   - Verifying that the sorting order (`createdAt DESC`) is maintained.\r\n3. Monitor query performance with larger datasets to confirm improvements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n- Updated query logic to include `ORDER BY createdAt DESC` and optional `LIMIT` in the PostgreSQL adapter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nI will attach screenshots of:\r\n- Successful working run with Postgres and SQLite.\r\n- Successful linting results.\r\n\r\n### Using Postgres adapter\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1054\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 13 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3606a21a-6933-402b-ae7d-d24ecb6a1263\" />\r\n<img width=\"1126\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 15 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b8a289-1cae-4a2f-9493-25cf79dc2d4b\" />\r\n\r\n### Using SQLite adapter\r\n<img width=\"1087\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 16 57 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a7f49f4-9880-4d4a-9586-d9548fda7dd5\" />\r\n<img width=\"543\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 18 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e04f844-ab14-44e3-a7f4-2601a853af46\" />\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 28 45 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82b35cad-c73a-46d0-b52c-5b1e05d87388\" />\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 29 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857b593f-f9e4-4774-a44a-358ea26155d8\" />\r\n",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8. Please let me know if anything is broke when you test it, it worked well on my end.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Shaiw Talks like Shaw\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/241b9420-8a6c-4115-ba73-7438bba91156)\r\n\r\n### Casual Conversation\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2b4a44-da93-4c80-902d-284222855811)\r\n\r\n### More\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adbf96ba-6f0b-4f58-8714-2fbc048b962e)\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nCaution: the docs site is crawled and inserted into vectordb on launch, each time you load the agent, this will happen. During testing, I suggest using cleanstart startup script, to wipe the database.  In production, this will need to be managed through db, if new pages are loaded.  This may need fixed in future to make this easier to manage.\r\n\r\n<!--  Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n## Database changes\r\nNeed to change from sqlite, to the database you use in test/production.\r\n\r\n<!--  If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n## Discord username\r\naah8098 (Allen)\r\n",

I've added the necessary comma so the code functions as intended.\r\n\r\nHere’s the fix I applied:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nenum ModelClass {\r\n    SMALL,    // Fast, efficient for simple tasks\r\n    MEDIUM,   // Balanced performance and capability\r\n    LARGE,    // Most capable but slower/more expensive\r\n    EMBEDDING // Specialized for vector embeddings\r\n    IMAGE     // Image generation capabilities\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nenum ModelClass {\r\n    SMALL,    // Fast, efficient for simple tasks\r\n    MEDIUM,   // Balanced performance and capability\r\n    LARGE,    // Most capable but slower/more expensive\r\n    EMBEDDING, // Specialized for vector embeddings\r\n    IMAGE     // Image generation capabilities\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis minor adjustment ensures that the values are properly separated in the enum, preventing potential issues down the line.",

Client App:\r\n- Added image display support in the chat interface\r\n- Implemented image upload functionality\r\n- Enhanced UI to handle image messages\r\n\r\n2. Client Direct:\r\n- Implemented image attachment handling in the `/:agentId/message` POST endpoint.\r\n- Added static file hosting for the direct client so that generated images and uploaded images can be displayed in the client.\r\n\r\n3. Plugin Node:\r\n- Added a `describeImage` Action in the plugin to take advantage of the `ImageDescriptionService` in the same plugin.\r\n- Modified `recognizeWithOpenAI` and `requestOpenAI` to accept local files, similar to how the first frame of .gif files is converted to a buffer and sent over the API\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. `packages/plugin-node/src/services/image.ts` - Core image processing service\r\n2.

    "title": "Feat: support TEE logging and support running eliza in Intel SGX",
    "body": "<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copy and pasting relevant items out of the html comments. -->\r\n\r\n# Relates to: \r\nKeywords: TEE, Intel SGX, Logging, Attestation, Verification, Gramine.\r\n\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section is to be filled out before final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces support for TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) logging and enables the Eliza application to run within Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions).\r\n\r\nAs Eliza is a fully autonomous AI agent capable of running within a TEE, we need to demonstrate to the outside world that we are indeed operating within a TEE. This allows external parties to verify that our actions are protected by the TEE and that they are entirely executed by Eliza, without any third-party interference. Therefore, it is necessary to leverage TEE's remote attestation and establish a TEE logging mechanism to prove that these operations are entirely and autonomously performed by Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the existing plugin-tee only supports running Eliza in dstack TDX CVM. However, although TDX is more convenient to use, Intel SGX remains a highly popular TEE in production environments. With the help of Gramine LibOS, it is possible to support running Eliza in SGX, thereby enabling the deployment of Eliza in a broader range of TEE scenarios.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n1. Support running Eliza in SGX\r\n2. Add plugin-sgx to support SGX attestation \r\n3. Add plugin-tee-log to support TEE logging (Gramine SGX and Dstack TDX)\r\n4. Add REST API in client-direct to support retrieve TEE logs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n## TEE Logging Mechanism:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Key Pair Generation and Attestation**:\r\n   - During startup, each agent generates a key pair and creates a remote attestation for the public key. The private key is securely stored in the TEE's encrypted memory. The agent's relevant information, along with the public key and attestation, is recorded in a local database. A new key pair is generated each time the agent is updated or restarted to ensure key security.\r\n\r\n2. **Log Recording**:\r\n   - For each log entry, basic information is recorded, including `agentId`, `roomId`, `userId`, `type`, `content`, and `timestamp`. This information is concatenated and signed using the agent's corresponding private key to ensure verifiability. The verification process follows this trust chain:\r\n     - Verify the attestation.\r\n     - Trust the public key contained in the attestation.\r\n     - Use the public key to verify the signature.\r\n     - Trust the complete log record.\r\n\r\n3. **Data Storage**:\r\n   - All log data must be stored in the TEE's encrypted file system in production environments. Storing data in plaintext is prohibited to prevent tampering.\r\n\r\n4. **Log Extraction for Verification**:\r\n   - Third parties can extract TEE logs for verification purposes. Two types of information can be extracted:\r\n     - **Agent Information**: This includes the agent's metadata, public key, and attestation, which can be used to verify the agent's public key.\r\n     - **Log Information**: Required logs can be extracted, with the agent's attestation and public key used to verify the signature, ensuring that each record remains untampered.\r\n\r\n5. **Integrity Protection**:\r\n   - When users extract TEE logs via the REST API, the results are hashed, and an attestation is generated. After extraction, users can verify the attestation by comparing the hash value contained within it to the extracted results, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeed to add new documentation about TEE logging and how to run Eliza in SGX\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. SGX Gramine support\r\n2. plugin-sgx\r\n3. plugin-tee-log\r\n4. other parts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n### Test SGX support\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to prepare the SGX environment and install the Gramine dependencies according to https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\r\n\r\nThen, start eliza in SGX:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npnpm i\r\npnpm build\r\n\r\n# Start default character\r\nSGX=1 make start\r\n# Start specific character\r\nSGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/trump.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test TEE logging\r\n\r\nTo get started, prepare the TEE environment. Both dstack TDX and Gramine SGX are supported.\r\n\r\nNext, enable TEE logging by configuring the .env file:\r\n```\r\nENABLE_TEE_LOG=true \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logging isn't integrated for actions by default, you need to integrate the logging for the actions you want to log. For example, if you want to log the `Continue` action of plugin-bootstrap, you can do the following:\r\n\r\nFirst, add plugin-tee-log to the dependencies of plugin-bootstrap:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"@elizaos/plugin-tee-log\": \"workspace:*\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, add the following code to the `Continue` action:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {\r\n    ServiceType,\r\n    ITeeLogService,\r\n} from \"@elizaos/core\";\r\n\r\n\r\n// In the handler of the action\r\n    handler: async (\r\n        runtime: IAgentRuntime,\r\n        message: Memory,\r\n        state: State,\r\n        options: any,\r\n        callback: HandlerCallback\r\n    ) => {\r\n        // Continue the action\r\n\r\n        // Log the action\r\n        const teeLogService = runtime\r\n            .getService<ITeeLogService>(ServiceType.TEE_LOG)\r\n            .getInstance();\r\n        if (teeLogService.log(\r\n                runtime.agentId,\r\n                message.roomId,\r\n                message.userId,\r\n                \"The type of the log, for example, Action:CONTINUE\",\r\n                \"The content that you want to log\"\r\n            )\r\n        ) {\r\n            console.log(\"Logged TEE log successfully\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Continue the action\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

In my tests, running Eliza smoothly in SGX requires configuring 64GB of EPC memory. Such a large memory footprint is caused by some indirect dependencies of Eliza on WASM. WASM requests a significant amount of memory during initialization, and configuring a smaller memory size will result in OOM (Out of Memory) errors.\r\n\r\nI will soon update a detailed step-by-step guide for running Eliza in SGX.\r\n"

        "body": "> SGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/c3po.character.json\"\r\n\r\nHi, I tested it in SGX using a clean project and have added a quick start guide for running it in SGX.\r\n\r\nDuring the following steps, the only issue I encountered was a build error caused by the missing plugin-tee dependency in plugin-tee-log. This error can be resolved by simply running the build command again. However, this is an issue that needs to be addressed later.\r\n\r\nOther than that, everything worked smoothly during the test. If you encounter any other issues while following these steps, please feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\nNote: Currently, I have set the SGX EPC size (memory size) to 64 GB in the Gramine manifest. In reality, Eliza itself does not require this much memory. However, some dependencies of Eliza rely on WebAssembly (WASM), and initializing WASM demands a significant amount of memory. If the memory is insufficient, you may encounter the following error:\r\n\r\n`RangeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Out of memory: Cannot allocate Wasm memory for a new instance.`\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this issue, I configured the enclave size to 64 GB. This is a temporary workaround, and we need to optimize WASM memory usage in the future.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to prepare a SGX enabled machine.\r\n\r\nThen, you can use the following command to start a Gramine Docker container:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo docker run -it --name eliza_sgx \\\r\n    --mount type=bind,source={your_eliza_path},target=/root/eliza \\\r\n    --device /dev/sgx/enclave \\\r\n    --device /dev/sgx/provision \\\r\n    gramineproject/gramine:stable-jammy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter entering the docker, you can use the following command to prepare the Eliza environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Generate the private key for signing the SGX enclave\r\ngramine-sgx-gen-private-key\r\n\r\ncd /root/eliza/\r\n\r\n# Install nodejs and pnpm\r\n# Node.js will be installed at `/usr/bin/node`.\r\n# Gramine will utilize this path as the default Node.js location to run Eliza.\r\n# If you prefer to use nvm for installing Node.js, please ensure to specify the Node.js path in the Makefile, as the installation path for nvm is not `/usr/bin/node`.\r\napt update\r\napt install -y build-essential\r\napt install -y curl\r\ncurl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_23.x | bash -\r\napt install -y nodejs=23.3.0-1nodesource1\r\nnpm install -g pnpm\r\n\r\n# Build Eliza\r\npnpm i\r\n# The build may fail on the first attempt due to the missing `plugin-tee` dependency in `plugin-tee-log`. Simply run the build command again to resolve the issue.\r\n# TODO: fix the build issue\r\npnpm build\r\n\r\n# Copy the .env.example file to .env\r\ncp .env.example .env\r\n# Edit the .env file\r\n\r\n# Start Eliza in SGX\r\nSGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/c3po.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n"

This is how choosing the action replies on Twitter works when the agent would like, re-tweet, Quote, or reply. \n\nIf I want a template to do conditional logic that executes 100% correctly, like a calculation, it would be beneficial, but maybe it's better to add tools for that case.\n\nFrom my point of view, this starts to approach a customized agent direction that requires new builds every time you add new logic. But if it doesn't break all templates w/ the new type accepting strings, then this can be useful.\n\nSome questions:\n- Does this require also editing all the other templates among the different clients as well?\n- Can we expand on the doc to make sure devs understand how to implement this?"

It simply introduces the possibility to pass a function that will resolve the template string. For me, this improves the developer experience by allowing developers to more easily customize their agents, and I’m personally a fan of using function resolvers when building SDKs.\n\nI updated the related documentation I could find, but I may have missed something."

    "title": "feat: Add Solana liquid staking support",
    "body": "Add the ability of liquid staking to the current elizaos solana plugin.\r\n\r\n- It can build the desired staking requests for end-users, eliminating the complexity of front-end development and the need for users to switch between multiple platforms to compare APYs and select staking protocols.\r\n- Currently supports five protocols: \"jito\", \"blaze\", \"jpool\", \"marinade\", \"marginfi\", and is capable of expanding to support more protocols.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1434\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- There are no risks. An independent new Solana feature module has been introduced without modifying the code of other parts.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- There are some distinctive liquid staking solutions on Solana. However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n- The StakeProtocolProvider uses the [Solana LST data provider](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/solana-lst-data-provider) open-sourced by stafiprotocol to provide data support. You can choose to use the default Stafi API or deploy it yourself.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Enable @elizaos/plugin-solana in the character.\r\n2. Interact with the Agent, for example: “My address is HqvTPqS2FaB2fQ7mxqZHQHz6H28o1u2Z9fRH5No8JN2W and I want to stake 0.01 SOL”.\r\n3. Obtain the response (the constructed staking transaction).",

    "title": "feat: suppress initial message from action",
    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nfeature: Suppressing initial response messages for specific actions in direct client\r\n\r\nI would like to also extend the twitter client to include this kind of functionality. Right now there is a lot of assumptions about agent behavior such as sending an initial message before an action is processed. Ideally during the upgrade to v2 some of these hard coded behaviors can be addressed. The design should be more conducive to plugin-defined emergent behavior. Maybe there's a discussion to be had at how we can go about this at a lower level rather than going client-by-client to implement this behavior. I'm still relatively new to Eliza community if anyone has groups or public discussions on this.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Changes only affect the direct client's message handling logic.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds support for suppressing initial response messages in the direct client when actions have `suppressInitialMessage` flag set to true. Some actions might not want to send a message until after the action is completed. Now the action will have to manually send a follow up message with the callback.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (changes to existing message handling features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNew property in the `Action` documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Check the modified message handling logic. I've changed `imageGeneration` action to include `suppressInitialMessage` to true for testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create an action with `suppressInitialMessage: true`\r\n2. Send a message to the direct client that triggers this action\r\n3. Verify only the callback message is sent, not the initial response\r\n\r\nKey test cases:\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: true` should only send callback message\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: false` or undefined should send both initial and callback messages\r\n- Action callback functionality should work the same regardless of suppression setting\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n```typescript\r\n                // Check if we should suppress the initial message\r\n                const action = runtime.actions.find(\r\n                    (a) => a.name === response.action\r\n                );\r\n                const shouldSuppressInitialMessage =\r\n                    action?.suppressInitialMessage;\r\n\r\n                const _result = await runtime.processActions(\r\n                    memory,\r\n                    [responseMessage],\r\n                    state,\r\n                    async (newMessages) => {\r\n                        message = newMessages;\r\n                        return [memory];\r\n                    }\r\n                );\r\n\r\n                if (!shouldSuppressInitialMessage) {\r\n                    if (message) {\r\n                        res.json([response, message]);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        res.json([response]);\r\n                    }\r\n                } else {\r\n                    if (message) {\r\n                        res.json([message]);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        res.json([]);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe changes ensure that when an action has `suppressInitialMessage` set to true:\r\n1. The initial response message is not sent in the API response\r\n2. The action's callback message is still sent if present\r\n3. The response array only includes the callback message",

This shift will scale message traffic astronomically, analogous to the web’s rise in the 2000s. Just as Cloudflare and https secured web traffic, messaging will need robust scalable end-to-end encrypted messages to protect sensitive information.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nRisks of not using end-to-end encryption for agent interactions exposes the users to what is called as Man in the **Middle Attacks**.\r\n\r\n> **Man in the Middle Attacks**: Intercept requests in between to alter or manipulate data sent or received by the AI service\r\n\r\n- **Phishing**: Messages can be intercepted and manipulated.\r\n- **Privacy**: Sensitive information read by unwanted parties\r\n- **Tampering**: Content can be altered without detection.\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> More concrete sensitive data could include credit card details, private keys and passwords which is not yet widely spread but as agents become smarter more use cases will include this type of sharing.\r\n\r\n## XMTP\r\n\r\nEliza agents come with a ready to use client that uses XMTP providing end-to-end encrypted messaging for every agent intereaction, crucial for privacy, security, and compliance provided by the XMTP network.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n\r\n- **E2EE**: End to end encrypted MLS encryption\r\n- **Multi-agent**: Support multi-agent through group chats\r\n- **Interoperable**: Works across all platforms and frontends\r\n- **Scalable**: Decentralized, open-source\r\n- **Anonymous**: By default every identity is ephemeral and anonymous.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nInstall the `xmtp` package\r\n\r\n```bash [cmd]\r\nbun install xmtp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis is how you can use the `xmtp` package to create an agent and handle messages.\r\n\r\n- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: This will encrypt all messages and make it available through its public address or ens domain.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { XMTP } from \"xmtp\";\r\n\r\nconst xmtp = new XMTP(onMessage, {\r\n    encryptionKey: WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY,\r\n});\r\nawait xmtp.init();\r\nconst onMessage = async (message, user) => {\r\n    console.log(`Decoded message: ${message.content.text} by ${user.address}`);\r\n    // Your AI model response\r\n    await xmtp.send({\r\n        message: response,\r\n        originalMessage: message,\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information visit XMTP [website](https://xmtp.org/)",

Removes the hard-coded `model class` from `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse`.  \r\n  2. Use the parameter to specify the desired model type.  \r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- **Risk Level**: Low  \r\n  - The change is confined to the internal logic of the `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse` function.  \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- Previously, `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse` did not allow dynamic model switching based on incoming parameters, limiting flexibility and making it cumbersome to use different models in various scenarios.  \r\n- By removing the hard-coded approach, developers can easily specify or configure the desired model without modifying core code.\r\n\r\n# What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- [x] **Bug fix** (fixes a reported issue)  \r\n- [ ] New feature (adds functionality)  \r\n- [ ] Other (please describe)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes  \r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Look at how `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse` now handles the incoming model parameter, and verify that any calling code is appropriately updated to use this new parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps  \r\n- Call `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse` with a specific model parameter, confirming that it correctly switches to the chosen model.  \r\n",

    "body": "Add the ability of liquid staking to the current elizaos solana plugin.\r\n\r\n- It can build the desired staking requests for end-users, eliminating the complexity of front-end development and the need for users to switch between multiple platforms to compare APYs and select staking protocols.\r\n- Currently supports five protocols: \"jito\", \"blaze\", \"jpool\", \"marinade\", \"marginfi\", and is capable of expanding to support more protocols.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1434\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- There are no risks. An independent new Solana feature module has been introduced without modifying the code of other parts.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- There are some distinctive liquid staking solutions on Solana. However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Enable @elizaos/plugin-solana in the character.\r\n2. Interact with the Agent, for example: “My address is HqvTPqS2FaB2fQ7mxqZHQHz6H28o1u2Z9fRH5No8JN2W and I want to stake 0.01 SOL”.\r\n3. Obtain the response (the constructed staking transaction).",

I suggest trying to do use the following to test it locally: \r\n\r\n• Description: “act” is a command-line utility written in Go that lets you run your GitHub Actions workflows locally.\r\n• How It Works: It parses your workflow .yml files and simulates GitHub Actions events (push, pull_request, etc.) in Docker containers on your local machine.\r\n• Why It’s Good:\r\n\r\nGreat for quickly iterating on a workflow without having to push to a branch repeatedly.\r\nLets you see console output, debug logs, and environment variables as if you were running on GitHub.\r\n• Potential Drawbacks:\r\nNot all GitHub Actions are guaranteed to work seamlessly. Some might rely on GitHub-hosted runners or environment specifics that “act” may not perfectly replicate.\r\nYou need Docker installed locally.\r\n• How to Get Started Quickly:\r\nInstall Docker.\r\nInstall act (on macOS you can use Homebrew: brew install act, or grab the binary from the GitHub releases page).\r\nFrom your repository, run:\r\nact <event_name>\r\nFor example, act push or act pull_request.\r\nBy default, act uses a lightweight Docker image for its runner; for more complex workflows you might need:\r\nact <event_name> --medium or --workflows .github/workflows/<your_workflow.yml>\r\n"

IN the sprit of OpenSource I wanted to make sure it was available for the whole community to use as well. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nA small additional input to the documentation is required to make users aware of the additional functionality and how it can be actioned. \r\nSimilar to the Postgres set up just adding in the appropriate connection string to the .env file will action he change to start using MongoDB as the database. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

After that the agent should run as expected, saving memories as before. The reviewer can verify the saved data inside the MongoDB interface. \r\n \r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1.

The main risks are:\r\n- Failed tweets due to rate limiting or authentication issues\r\n- Potential for tweets that are too long (mitigated by automatic truncation)\r\n- No risk to existing functionality as this is an isolated plugin\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a Twitter plugin that enables posting tweets through the agent-twitter-client package. Key features:\r\n- Implements POST_TWEET action for sending tweets\r\n- Handles Twitter authentication via environment variables\r\n- Automatically truncates tweets that exceed character limits\r\n- Provides detailed error handling and logging\r\n- Supports dry run mode for testing\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Adds new Twitter posting capability\r\n- Uses the standalone agent-twitter-client package\r\n- Implements proper error handling and character limit enforcement\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n- Add Twitter plugin setup instructions\r\n- Document required environment variables:\r\n  - TWITTER_USERNAME\r\n  - TWITTER_PASSWORD\r\n  - TWITTER_EMAIL\r\n  - TWITTER_DRY_RUN (optional)\r\n  - TWITTER_2FA_SECRET (optional)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review `packages/plugin-twitter/src/actions/post.ts` for the main implementation\r\n2. Check error handling in postTweet function\r\n3. Review tweet composition logic in composeTweet function\r\n4. Verify environment variable handling\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Set up environment variables in `.env`:\r\n```bash\r\nTWITTER_USERNAME=your_username\r\nTWITTER_PASSWORD=your_password\r\nTWITTER_EMAIL=your_email\r\nTWITTER_DRY_RUN=false\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Test tweet posting:\r\n```bash\r\n# Start with dry run mode\r\nTWITTER_DRY_RUN=true pnpm dev\r\n\r\n# Test actual posting\r\nTWITTER_DRY_RUN=false pnpm dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Verify error handling:\r\n- Try posting a tweet > 180 characters (should truncate)\r\n- Try posting with invalid credentials (should show error)\r\n- Try posting with missing credentials (should validate)\r\n\r\n4. Check logging:\r\n- Verify credential validation logs\r\n- Check tweet content generation logs\r\n- Verify error messages are descriptive\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n- Requires agent-twitter-client package\r\n- Environment variables must be set for Twitter authentication\r\n- No database changes required",

    "title": "feat: add birdeye plugin",
    "body": "This is my first attempt to contribute to this project. I have been adding features and additional query capability for the Birdeye API and I think many other could benefit.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\n- plugin ecosystem and capabilities for accessing and querying Birdeye data API\r\n- [Expanding Birdeye thread](https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1318974518680748173)\r\n- possible overlap with: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1366\r\n\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- People who already have the BIRDEYE_API_KEY enabled could end up querying the endpoints more\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nThis pull request significantly enhances the Birdeye API integration within the AI agent framework by expanding its capabilities beyond basic query functionality. The proposed tools enable more comprehensive and versatile interactions with the Birdeye API, including data clearing and management features. These improvements provide the AI agents with a broader and more efficient toolkit for handling Birdeye API data, enhancing the overall flexibility and utility of the framework for developers and end-users. By extending the scope of the API integration, this contribution supports more robust and scalable solutions within the project.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds providers that represent all the different API endpoints available in the Birdeye API. By doing so, it ensures that when a user requests a specific type of data, the AI agent has a significantly higher likelihood of accessing and utilizing the relevant data in its response. This enhancement maximizes the agent’s ability to provide accurate and contextually rich answers, leveraging the full scope of the Birdeye API.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- net new plugin\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis API connection is critical for enabling the agent to perform research and analyze the dynamics of the ecosystem effectively. By integrating comprehensive access to all Birdeye API endpoints, this PR lays the groundwork for future enhancements and features that will further expand the agent's capabilities. This integration not only empowers the agent to deliver more insightful and accurate responses but also positions the framework for scalable growth and the addition of advanced functionalities in the future.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a document change is needed, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Yes, this will require the docs to be updated. I am happy to update the appropriate project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- Pull the branch\r\n- Enable plugin by setting the BIRDEYE_API_KEY\r\n- Utilize the web console as ask questions about onchain data. \r\n- Example prompts:\r\n-- give me a list of wallets on solana that i should be following\r\n-- tell me more about BbJgE7HZMaDp5NTYvRh5jZSkQPVDTU8ubPFtpogUkEj4\r\n-- what are the top gainers today\r\n-- what is the current price of HIPPO?\r\n-- what tokens are tredning today on sui? \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\nhttps://x.com/sunosuporno/status/1870967395780792741\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nTwo main things:\r\n1. Update `generateText` API to be able to pass through tool options to leverage the model's tool calling capabilities\r\n2. Update the GOAT plugin to use tool calling allowing it to perform complex onchain actions that require multiple steps. Now developers can define high level actions (swap, bet on Polymarket, stake, etc.) and GOAT will take care of handling each action (see the screenshots below)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nI have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo and build it\r\n2. Set up the `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` env variables\r\n3. Uncomment lines 70-72 in the `actions.ts` file in the GOAT plugin\r\n4. Prompt the agent with \"Swap 0.1 USDC for MODE using KIM in a single hop\"\r\n5. In the agent logs you should see all the different steps that the agent is making\r\n6. The tx should fail unless you have ETH and USDC in MODE :)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\nAgent can just do one function call so you need to specify the inputs like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11cec757-fdb1-43b8-affc-562380a38184)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After\r\nAgent can do multiple function calls in an action so inputs are more human friendly:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f80382c-f48f-4096-a2ab-a2cafa72477d)\r\n\r\nIn the background you can also log all the different tool interactions:\r\n<img width=\"630\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 16 24 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/627792d8-eeb7-4110-b2ef-33dd8c83f3da\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\naguspunk\r\n",

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\n1. Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241222%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241222T094432Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=1a5dd5544d9787bd4b80ce1fa9db82a9647389b7df93cfd2c0c41a3d7400e4b9)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

    "body": "### What this PR does\r\n\r\n1. **Adds comprehensive test coverage** for our `stringToUuid` function:\r\n    - Checks UUID format (length, hyphen placement, regex matching).\r\n    - Verifies version and variant bits (RFC 4122 compliance).\r\n    - Tests various inputs (numbers, Unicode, empty strings, edge cases).\r\n    - Ensures consistent, deterministic output.\r\n2. **Fixes the version bits** to properly label the UUID as “version 5”:\r\n    - Previously, we weren’t strictly setting the top nibble in `hashBuffer[6]` to `0x5`.\r\n    - This change enforces RFC 4122 compliance by setting `(hashBuffer[6] & 0x0f) | 0x50`.\r\n\r\n### Why this matters\r\n\r\n- **Correct RFC 4122 compliance**: We now correctly produce v5 UUIDs.\r\n- **Potentially breaking**: The new code produces different UUID strings for the same input (re-keys everything). Any stored references or comparisons to old UUIDs will no longer match.\r\n\r\n### Risks & Impact\r\n\r\n- **Risk**: Existing code/data relying on old UUIDs may break or create duplicates.\r\n- **Mitigation**: We can choose to:\r\n    1. Merge only the **tests** for now, keeping the existing UUID generation.\r\n    2. Merge the bit fix (and re-key), but accept the breaking change or plan a migration.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\n1. **(Option A)** Merge only the tests and skip the version-bit fix for now (to avoid re-keying).\r\n2. **(Option B)** Merge both tests and fix, but coordinate any needed data migration or accept re-keying.",

Version-Bit Fix — applies the change that correctly sets the version 5 bits, which would re-key existing data.\r\n\r\nSince the second part can be disruptive, I’d appreciate guidance or help on how best to handle existing data or references.

Assuming ~400 ms blocktimes, this amounts to 60 seconds. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?

    "body": "_sup fam, today i put in a few hours to extend the Eliza framework by adding some core trading functionality for on-chain solana bots. my focus was to create a set of tools that will allow agents to execute trades, manage risk, and pull critical data. here's what I added and worked on:_\r\n\r\n**What I Added/Completed Today:**\r\n\r\n1. nice_funcs.py:\r\n\r\n- Added a library of helpful functions tailored for Solana on-chain trading.\r\n- Functions now include position management, wallet holdings fetching, and other utilities to make trading more efficient.\r\n- This has been tested with my personal bots but should integrate well with Eliza’s architecture.\r\n\r\n2. bot.py:\r\n\r\n- Built a script that allows agents to perform trading actions such as:\r\n- Closing a position (action 0).\r\n- Opening a position (action 1).\r\n- Adding stop-loss logic (action 2).\r\n- Implementing breakout trades (action 3).\r\n- Market-making logic (action 5).\r\n- Currently, it uses basic user input to decide the action, but this will soon be fully bot-driven.\r\n\r\n3. get_ohlcv_data.py\r\n\r\n- this allows the agent to get open, high, low, close and volume data\r\n- also have moving averages and examples of other technical indicators\r\n\r\n4. dontshare.py (ignored):\r\n\r\n- Added placeholders for sensitive information such as:\r\n- Solana private keys.\r\n- BirdEye API keys.\r\n- RPC URLs.\r\n- Added this file to .gitignore to ensure it doesn’t get accidentally pushed.\r\n\r\n5. Updated README.md:\r\n\r\n- Wrote a comprehensive README to document how to use these new tools and scripts.\r\n- It includes detailed steps for configuration, usage, and what each action/script does.\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Why This Matters:**\r\n\r\n- These tools lay the groundwork for enabling AI agents to perform advanced trading strategies directly on-chain.\r\n- The added functionality simplifies interaction with Solana contracts while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.\r\n- It ensures agents can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention—just plug in the strategy, and they're good to go.\r\n\r\n**What's Next?**\r\n\r\n- I'm researching the best way to transition from Python to TypeScript or add a shell for TS compatibility, depending on the project direction.\r\n- Planning to integrate more trading actions like:\r\n- Funding buys (action 6).\r\n- Liquidation monitoring (action 7).\r\n- Always happy to hear feedback on how this integrates with Eliza’s current architecture and if there are specific improvements to focus on.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity to contribute. Let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to adjust or refine for tomorrow.",

Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1.

This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n \r\n# Detailed testing steps\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

But tested with clearing cache and cached, working great.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the .env variable TWITTER_COOKIES and simply uses twitterScraper to manage cookies on login better from cache.\r\n\r\nIt also removes the docs / readme step where user has to provide the JSON array of TWITTER_COOKIES.\r\n\r\nSide win: the looping try-catch while loop is cleaner to read, deleted many lines of code in simpler implementation for twitter auth.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nTWITTER_COOKIES env var is an added complexity not required, users have to go searching in dev-tools console `document.cookie` and rearrange their JSON and add to ENV. But, twitter-scraper client has support for login + fetch current cookies on it's own. It is a redundant ENV setup that can be removed to simplify the twitter agent setup process for all users.\r\n\r\nI recently implemented twitter-scapper-client in my own custom agent and never had todo this ENV setup, I saw it as a EZ win for Eliza community to port over.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have removed the TWITTER_COOKIES docs sections, full deletion, no longer needed.\r\n\r\nPlease show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba2b848b-2c47-4ba7-a3ca-7f3fa8172129)\r\n\r\nI also ran:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn await this.runtime.cacheManager.delete(\r\n    `twitter/${username}/cookies`\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo delete the cookies from cache manually to verify my code was working.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nRemove TWITTER_COOKIES from .env and see if Twitter agent boots correctly and works from fresh cache and already cached.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNone, automated tests are fine. \r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nRemove TWITTER_COOKIES from any CI / CD and .env test runners.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\ncjft\r\n",

This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. \n\n### Details\nI have exploited this vulnerability in a Windows service using version 5.22.11 of the module, to escalate privileges (in an environment where I am authorized to do so).

The implementation provides a reusable and scalable solution for caching data in the application by also implementing the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n\r\n**Implemented Features:**\r\n- `getCache`: Retrieves cached data for a given `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `setCache`: Caches data with a unique key constructed using `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `deleteCache`: Removes cached data for the specified `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- Proper error handling and logging for all Redis operations.\r\n- Integration with the `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` interface.\r\n\r\n**Code Highlights:**\r\n- A new `RedisClient` class implements the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n- The `buildKey` method ensures unique Redis keys for each agent and operation.\r\n- `ioredis` is used for efficient Redis interactions, supporting advanced Redis features like clusters and pipelines if needed in the future.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Provides a scalable and reusable caching solution.\r\n- Ensures clear separation of concerns and adheres to the existing interface.\r\n- Improves application performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe implementation has been tested for the following scenarios:\r\n- Successfully setting a cache entry.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that exists.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that does not exist.\r\n- Deleting a cache entry.\r\n- Handling Redis errors gracefully during operations.\r\n",

Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE.\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

    "title": "feat: AWS Secrets Manager Integration",
    "body": "# Relates to: AWS Secrets Manager Integration & Security\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nThis reduces risks by allowing offloading all API keys and secrets to Secrets Manager instead of leaving them raw in a .env\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nIn settings.ts in package/core, rather than just pulling from .env, it also grabs any secrets manager secret names you specify. You can STILL keep all your keys directly in .env, but if you specify \"SECRET_NAMES\" in your .env, it will pull secrets through that from AWS along with anything in the .env\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Create an AWS account. Free-tier is enough. \r\n2. In Secrets Manager, create a secret named \"secret/myagentname\" (this can be named anything but this format is nice). \r\n3. Add in all the keys you have in your .env currently as key value pairs in this secret and save.\r\n\r\n### IAM Role Setup:\r\nFirst, create an IAM Policy:\r\n\r\nGo to AWS Console → IAM → Policies → Create Policy\r\nSelect JSON and use this policy document:\r\n\r\njsonCopy{\r\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\r\n    \"Statement\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n            \"Action\": [\r\n                \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\r\n                \"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Resource\": [\r\n                \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:secret:*\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nName it something like \"SecretsManagerReadAccess\"\r\n\r\n### Create the IAM Role:\r\n\r\nGo to IAM → Roles → Create Role\r\nChoose your use case:\r\n\r\nFor EC2: Select \"AWS service\" and \"EC2\"\r\nFor Lambda: Select \"AWS service\" and \"Lambda\"\r\nFor other services: Choose appropriate trust relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nAttach the policy you just created (\"SecretsManagerReadAccess\")\r\nName the role (e.g., \"SecretsManagerRole\")\r\n\r\n\r\n### Get the Role ARN:\r\n\r\nAfter creating the role, click into it\r\nCopy the \"Role ARN\" from the summary section\r\nIt will look like: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SecretsManagerRole\r\nThis is what you'll put in your .env file as AWS_ROLE_ARN\r\n\r\n\r\n### If you're using this with EC2:\r\n\r\nAttach this role to your EC2 instance\r\nGo to EC2 → Select instance → Actions → Security → Modify IAM Role\r\nSelect the role you created\r\n\r\n\r\n### For local development:\r\n\r\nYou'll need AWS credentials configured locally\r\nUse aws configure with credentials that can assume this role\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your new ENV could look like this:\r\nAWS_REGION=us-east-1\r\nSECRET_NAMES=secret/ropAIrito\r\nAWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::[REPLACE WITH YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER WITHOUT THE BRACKETS]:role/secrets-access-role \r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT TO NOTE**: You can use the .env just how it has normally been used in the Eliza repo. This is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nSecurity change / cleanup / ease of use\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nJust think it is more secure to pull from secrets manager, especially if people are hosting their agent on AWS, but this will work even if you host elsewhere as long as you have the a service role with secrets manager access specified in the \"AWS_ROLE_ARN\".\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMaybe just an explainer that Secrets Manager is useable with Eliza.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb09a61-fb4e-457a-8209-9eb7e6d53eca)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ddcd2b7-8fce-4e0c-8c90-a25af4ce5d3f)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a286a34-b560-4adb-b633-acb6a1209969)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd96be74-4966-41a2-babc-7e4c625bdbbe)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/166014ea-9185-4bb0-b2d7-433c5ac50e25)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nTake a look at settings.ts in the core package. \r\n\r\n### Discord Username\r\n\r\nropirito",

This PR adds support for Eliza to interact with the Treasure mainnet, with logic/implementation borrowed from #1225 and #1128.\r\n\r\nInitially, only the `transfer` function has been supported with additional features to come to hook into the Treasure Development Kit (TDK), Magicswap, and other Treasure platform features.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nSpin up an agent with the `treasure` plugin + review `plugin-treasure`.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. In `.env`, should set the value for `TREASURE_ADDRESS` (public address for the agent account), `TREASURE_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key for the same account), and `TREASURE_RPC_URL` as https://rpc.treasure.lol.\r\nTo test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. [Treasure Bridge](https://bridge.treasure.lol/) can be used to bridge MAGIC directly from `arb1` to an address on `treasure`.\r\n2. Run the agent and prompt it with: \"Send 0.1 MAGIC to \" - e.g. \"send 0.1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\"\r\n3. Assuming you had 1 MAGIC to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. \"Successfully sent 1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\r\nTransaction: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Treasure Block Explorer (https://treasurescan.io/)",

On testnet, you can use the [Avail Faucet](https://faucet.avail.tools/).

Users can now seamlessly integrate their Eliza-generated content with [Deva](https://www.deva.me/), enhancing their content distribution and engagement strategies.\r\n\r\n### What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Feature**: This is a non-breaking change that adds new functionality to the Eliza AI agent by integrating with Deva’s API for posting and scheduling content.\r\n\r\n## Documentation Changes Needed?\r\n\r\nNot at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Create a Deva Account**\r\n    - Navigate to [deva.me](https://www.deva.me/), create an account, and press the \"Get Started\" button in the top right.\r\n    - ![Get Started](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a31ebe01-3ee7-40f5-8e30-f59c79c642fe)\r\n\r\n2. **Complete Onboarding**\r\n    - Click through the onboarding screens and connect your preferred social account (e.g., Twitter) to Deva.\r\n\r\n3. **Access the Deva Feed**\r\n    - You can now see the Deva feed, where you can post and interact with other Devas.\r\n    - <img width=\"1462\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63a95b6e-779a-4864-b37c-5a848bde4c52\" />\r\n\r\n4. **Create an Application to get the token**\r\n    - At this point, you'll be able to get a token to interact with Deva, to do so: \r\n        - Navigate to Apps chapter in settings by clicking the user icon in top right corner and then settings -> Apps, or opening [apps](https://www.deva.me/settings/apps)\r\n        - Press Apps and Session\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fda36ac-3675-4f30-8c48-9b91e71a741e)\r\n        - Press Create new app\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fc9b04-510e-4a90-876c-e4f6d2e562d7)\r\n        - You are redirected to the form of the app creation, Name, Redirect URL and descriptions are necessary fields. Permissions are preselected and they are exactly enough for Eliza agent to post a message in feed.\r\n        - After creating an app, select it from the list of apps;\r\n        - Inside you will find a Get Token button, to generate a new token for your app:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/307ab088-0508-496e-bc8e-4ded833e8b4f)\r\n        - Later, it'll be visible in the list:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39034c0d-3cf3-4a69-aaab-8cd1740d9ba6)\r\n\r\n5. **Update Environment Variables**\r\n    - Once you have the token, update the environment variables in the `.env` file:\r\n      ```env\r\n      DEVA_API_KEY=YourApiKey\r\n      DEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.deva.me # Production API URL\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n6. **Select Deva Client as Default Character**\r\n    - Select the Deva client as Eliza's default character and choose the desired model:\r\n      <br/>![Select Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1120ebb4-4618-4364-bbf8-7040b6bda8c0)\r\n\r\n7. **Run the Application**\r\n    - Execute the following commands to install dependencies and start the application:\r\n      ```bash\r\n      pnpm install && pnpm start\r\n      ```\r\n    - This will initiate the Deva client:\r\n      <br/>![Initiate Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef64f0b-c2c1-4a4b-a6b5-0461433af022)\r\n    - Fetch the persona associated with your agent and the posts that you have pushed to the Deva feed:\r\n      <br/>![Fetch Persona and Posts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a698b06-b616-47cc-8318-355a91cc424c)\r\n    - Once done, Eliza will post one message to the Deva feed immediately and schedule another one as a test message:\r\n      <br/>![Post Messages](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523d69f4-1f3f-4d49-82a1-163e3cd4d128)\r\n8. **Eliza agent's post is in the feed!**\r\n   - <img width=\"621\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bd7cd5-7e3a-4c64-9597-9b0909642189\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### Staging Environment Testing\r\n\r\nTo avoid populating the production Deva feed, you can perform the same flow in the [staging environment](https://staging.deva.me/). Ensure you update the related environment variable:\r\n\r\n```env\r\nDEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api-staging.deva.me # Staging API URL\r\n",

Trump says silly offensive stuff, and we wanted to capture that. He would not say SARS-COVID-19. I disagree with about 99% of the stuff he says, and 99% of the stuff his character file says. That being said, I care about art, and not letting art be compromised by politics.\r\n\r\nWe love people all over the world, and personally I will be visiting China in a couple days to meet everyone. I don't believe that we should be against any group for their nationality. But we shouldn't kill the comedy and make our characters worse-- that's why OpenAI's models suck now. It's a slippery slope that will reduce bravery, integrity and quality."

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nFor a production ready - multi-character Eliza setup, we want to load new characters in runtime via API calls.\r\nWe do not want to restart the Eliza server for each new character.\r\n\r\n_ASSUMPTION:_ \r\nAn api or script exists to store the characters in DB.\r\nThe api uses the same stringToUUID method to create consistent UUIDs for a character and store in DB.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- Allows loading characters from DB during start\r\n- Allows loading characters via REST API from DB during runtime\r\n- The characters are stored in TEXT/JSONB format - similar to the character Agent file in sqlite and postgres respectively\r\n- Securely encrypts each character's secrets using AES-256 encryption and then stores in DB (Decrypt after fetch)\r\n- Proper error handling for all scenarios \r\n    - Character already loaded in runtime\r\n    - Character does not exist in db\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nThis is a new Feature\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\nCurrently \r\n1) For adding any new agent, we need to restart the Eliza server => All the agents and its clients are loaded again - All previous tweets (incase of twitter client), interactions are processed again. Any existing direct or telegram conversation is lost. \r\n2) Not a straight-forward mechanism to add new agents - Now with a REST API - load new agents.\r\n\r\nWhy are we doing this?\r\nTo take a step towards multi-character production setup\r\n\r\n### Code Changes made and why?\r\n1. **Created a new table in postgres and sqlite** - Added in the seed file/script of both DBs\r\n`\r\nexport type CharacterTable = {\r\n    id: UUID;                                                // created from stringToUUID - unique and consistent for name\r\n    name: string;\r\n    characterState: Character;                 // A JSONB or TEXT - that maps the character\r\n    secretsIV?: Secrets;                            // Initialisation Vector for each secrets\r\n};\r\n`\r\n**Also added the above in packages/core/src/types.ts**\r\n2. **in SqliteAdapter and PostgresAdapter** - created a new function to load from this characters table\r\n3. **in Agents/src/index.ts** -> \r\n- Assign Directclient to a global variable - along with set and get methods. This is to allow the same direct client be used for character(agent) runtime creation\r\n- A function loadCharactersFromDb loadCharactersFromDb(\r\n                            characterNames?: string\r\n                        ): Promise<Character[]> \r\n    - if any characterNames argument received, it fetches only those characters from db\r\n    - else fetches all characters\r\n    - This handles encryption and decryption of secrets if secrets are present in a character\r\n    - uses env.ENCRYPTION_KEY\r\n- An express server\r\n   - The server starts only when the env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT == true\r\n   - _Why not use the same express server in DirectClient?_ DirectClient does not have access to the DB methods and all the agent-specific handling methods\r\n   - ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - PORT: default. - 3001, overwritten by env AGENT_PORT\r\n4. **in packages/client-direct/src/index.ts**\r\n- Added ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - This endpoint (is a proxy) that routes request to the agent server's route\r\n   -    Before proxying, checks if AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT  ==true and if agents already in runtime\r\n5. created a file **packages/core/src/crypt.ts**\r\n- This handles the encryption and decryption methods\r\n6. created scripts that parses a character json file or all files in a folder and inserts in DB\r\n- Location: scripts/importCharactersInDB/[postgres/sqlite]/insertInDb.js\r\nRequires env variable\r\n`\r\nPOSTGRES_URL= # if postgres\r\nENCRYPTION_KEY=\"\"\r\nINPUT_PATH=characters # the folder path to load the characters from\r\nSQLITE_DB_PATH= #if you want to change db path Default: agent/data/db.sqlite\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

Fetching from database during start\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=true\r\n- `pnpm start`\r\n- Will function as usual\r\n- if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n2. Loading an agent during runtime\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=false #if true, we can't test load as all characters in db will be loaded\r\n- set env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT=true\r\n- set env ENCRYPTION_KEY= #use the same encryption key used in insertInDB.js script\r\n- set env AGENT_PORT=4000 #can be empty if we want to pick default port 3001\r\n`pnpm start`\r\n- This will load with the default character Eliza\r\n- `curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/load/trump'` - replace port and character name if using different characters\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 1: agent is loaded and we get success code 200\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 2: agent is already loaded and we get error code 409\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 3: agent does not exist in db and we get error code 404\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 4:  Error during agent load - like incorrect twitter - error code 500\r\n-  if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automtated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

Fixed Chain Name Formatting:\r\n- Object generation sometimes returned the chain name without quotes, causing the transfer action to fail.\r\n- Improved this behavior by ensuring quotes are added in the constraint:\r\n```ts\r\nchains.map((item) => `\"${item}\"`).join(\"|\")\r\n```\r\n2. Added Linting Script:\r\n- Introduced a linting script to the project and fixed the linting errors.\r\n3. Restored Transfer Action Logic:\r\n- The merge of #965 degraded the transfer action by ignoring the buildTransferDetails() function.\r\n- This function has been reintegrated into the transfer action.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- Try initiate a transfer action with on the evm chain of your choice, the agent should correctly pick the chain.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes rely on automated tests.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou\r\n",

        "body": "@lessuselesss love this PR, but there are some weird problems that will cause a NixOS user to fail when building the codebase with nix flakes enabled.\r\n\r\nFor example, I built this on my NixOS machine and we see this error:\r\n```\r\nWARN  Unsupported engine: wanted: {\"node\":\"23.3.0\"} (current: {\"node\":\"v20.18.1\",\"pnpm\":\"9.15.0\"})\r\ndocs                                     |  WARN  Unsupported engine: wanted: {\"node\":\"23.3.0\"} (current: {\"node\":\"v20.18.1\",\"pnpm\":\"9.15.0\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may think...what?! No Way...But how?? The pkgs specifically lists `nodejs_23` and when I run `node version` I will see the `v23.2.0`, but that still does not equal `v20.18.1`.\r\n\r\nSo I did some digging bc Nix can be a pain in the ass at times with weird dependencies errors. So I checked the `pnpm` pkgs source code and found this line https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/394571358ce82dff7411395829aa6a3aad45b907/pkgs/development/tools/pnpm/generic.nix#L28\r\n\r\nAnd `nodejs` pkg points to:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e258b67-924e-4471-a590-d7bde3ac7c64)\r\n\r\nSo this here is the culprit for why a NixOS user will hit this weird error even though we declaratively chose the right node version."

Core Tests Status:\r\n- All 121 tests passed (with 1 skipped)\r\n- Clean execution with no major issues\r\n- Test duration: 1.52s\r\n\r\n2. Plugin Tests Status:\r\n- Several plugins executed tests successfully (e.g., solana plugin: 5 tests passed)\r\n- Some failures were observed:\r\n  - plugin-evm: 3 failed tests due to network connectivity issues with IoTeX endpoints\r\n  - plugin-0g: Test process hangs and requires manual interruption\r\n  - Several plugins have no test scripts configured yet\r\n\r\n3. Regarding the nix environment:\r\n- Tests are running through the nix shell environment successfully\r\n- The test infrastructure itself works as expected\r\n- We're seeing expected behavior with node modules and dependencies\r\n\r\n4. Areas for Improvement:\r\n- Some plugins need test script configurations\r\n- Network-dependent tests (like EVM) might need mocking or better error handling\r\n- The plugin-0g hanging issue needs investigation\r\n\r\nRegarding your question about an overlay - yes, that sounds like a good approach so I've gone ahead and made an attempt.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like me to focus on any specific area or if you need more details about the test results."

    "body": "\r\n# Relates to: -\r\nNo Tickets\r\n\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow, new model added\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nMost developers don't have in-house hardware to run models like LLAMA3.1-405B and so they'll have some sort of server setup. This usually costs money, however there exists a free option today: chatapi.akash.network. This is an openAI api compatible api that runs standard LLMs like llama3.1-405B and llama3.3-70B for free! \r\n\r\nThe official announcement of the public release: https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1814018478845616362 \r\nYou can get your api key here: https://chatapi.akash.network\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a new model provider to the list of model providers\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nIm a big fan of the work of akash.network and I've been using this service myself for a while now. Its great to have access to bigger models for testing without risking huge token spends on your personal creditcard\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. The env variables are added in the .env.example including the relevant links to where to get the key and how it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nI tested it by following the steps below and got the following result:\r\n<img width=\"391\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-16 at 3 35 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e89c34-e8f5-47c3-9ffa-130152d65227\" />\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nFollow the test steps below (should be really easy!)\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nEasiest way to test is to do the following:\r\n1. clone repo\r\n2. Go to https://chatapi.akash.network and request a new api key (no email required, optional)\r\n3. run `cp .env.example .env` in the root and set the api key here\r\nhttps://github.com/MbBrainz/eliza/blob/de87bfaa308091ff14ff488f5a446cf72b8904c4/.env.example#L234C1-L238C73 \r\n4. change the model provider in  `./packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` to `modelProvider: ModelProviderName.AKASH_CHAT_API,`\r\n5. run `pnpm build & pnpm start`\r\n6. send a msg and verify if the model is akash_chat_api and if it responds\r\n7 ✅\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nMbBrainz\r\n",

[Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) can be used to send ZKCRO directly to an address on Cronos zkEVM\r\n\r\nRun the agent and prompt it with: \"send 0.5 ZKCRO to \" - e.g. \"send 1 ZKCRO to 0xee0c40F86544a8b0616BC827728f714a8B4cEeE7\"\r\n\r\nAssuming you had 1 ZKCRP to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. Transfer completed successfully! \"tx: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Cronos zkEVM explorer (https://explorer.zkevm.cronos.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--  Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--  If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

There is a risk of potential issues if the frozen lock file is not respected, which could lead to inconsistent dependency versions across environments.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the installation commands across various files to ensure that the `pnpm install` command uses the `--frozen-lockfile` option. This prevents the lock file from being incorrectly updated during installations. Additionally, an explicit update script has been added to allow updates without the frozen lock file option. We updated the .npmrc default to set frozen-lockfile=true and in order to update the lockfile when you add a new dependency in your package.json or bump a version in your package.json you need to explicitly call pnpm i --no-frozen-lockfile \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Improvements**: This change improves the dependency management process by enforcing the use of a consistent lock file during installations.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

        "body": "Hey @monilpat, I've already started working on this during weekend myself. See this branch: [jure/fix-workflows-and-docs](https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/tree/jure/fix-workflows-and-docs). I even went so far to try to update Chinese etc. READMEs, which is of course complete nonsense since I don't even understand what is written there. Furthermore, there are scripts that use `pnpm install` that I cannot really test, and since it they are undocumented it's impossible to tell if they should be changed or not.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had a thought to update all references to `pnpm install`, but I changed my mind because it's not a black/white decision. People need to understand how lockfiles work, and if they are not using them properly it is not our ability (or responsibility) to educate them. The issues we're seeing today with lockfiles are the result of (1) `npm` / `pnpm`'s design decision (or rather, a change of), and (2) carelesness.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution therefore boils down to PR reviewers. In particular:\r\n- The `main` and `develop` branches should always be \"stable\", i.e. having passing tests\r\n- Whenever a PR introduces a change that causes tests to fail, it should not be merged until the cause of failure is established and corrected.\r\n\r\nThat said, the tests can fail for more than lockfile being out of sync, and we should probably focus on making them work in a reliable way. One of key issues is that our tests depend on external things such as OpenAI and API keys. I would recommend adding a separate smoke test just for OpenAI (a simple `curl` command)."

This will also enable autonomous agent to unify all input and outputs into a single stream of thought and action.\r\n\r\n* Unified agent wallet\r\nThe current wallet system reflects the way we use humans use wallets today, but the UX around network switching and wallet management is a pain. Instead, the agent will have a unified wallet, with access to all registered chains at once. No wallet switching, and tokens will all be handled by agents in a unified way.\r\n\r\n* CLI Tool\r\nWe want a create-react-app like experience for creating new projects, and we want CLI handlers for adding and removing plugins, opening chat interface in browser, maybe even deploying like Cloudflare Wrangler to some of our deployment provider friends. Should also handle secrets management and character / agent / conversation management.\r\n\r\n* Model Provider Registry\r\nThe current model provider system requires a pull request to core for every model provider. v2 will have a registry and override pattern so new code doesn't need to be added to core, and any provider can quickly override with a few lines of code to add integration without a pull request.\r\n\r\n* Extensible and generic core framework\r\nThe v1 is very opinionated about prompts, state and some features. v2 will be very extensible so you can create different kinds of agents and override state management and context composition. For advanced developers, this will make the framework far more powerful and flexible for different user cases.\r\n\r\n* Community plugins\r\nWe'll be moving community plugins out of core and adding requirements for plugin inclusion in core around test coverage, documentation and code maintenance and ownership.\r\n\r\n* Better secret management\r\nCurrently, secret management in .env and character files is risky, so considering better and more secure options for this\r\n\r\n* 100% Test Coverage\r\nv2 reflects what we want Eliza to be, and we feel that after these changes we should focus entirely on stability, security and cutting down on issues. We'll be aiming for 100% test coverage of core, adapters and primary components, and end-to-end tests for clients.",

Built to support twitter for now.\r\n\r\nLeverages Privy as the account repository and Privy import feature to add users social account. This creates a wallet on behalf of the user that they can claim by logging in with twitter on that Privy instance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the data source could be replaced with an onchain social registry that anyone can opt into themselves to link their socials to a wallet, using TEE-verified oauth. With a reserve vault smart contract layer on top of that, this could hold tokens sent to users that haven't signed up yet and then easily be claimed on signup.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nTo enable agents to send tokens directly to twitter handles without having to know the users wallet address. This could spark entirely new forms of meta games, stories, and economies.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61408862-0a18-4e8e-a656-914dc83f8ee0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ff281c-a152-4f57-8af7-77296e764009)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9b75c4-f29c-4c7f-8f70-70e44770afb4)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`/packages/plugin-social-wallets`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nAdd env values for:\r\n- PRIVY_APP_ID\r\n- PRIVY_APP_SECRET\r\n- EVM_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n- TWITTER_USERNAME\r\n- TWITTER_PASSWORD\r\n- TWITTER_EMAIL\r\n\r\nRun `sh ./scripts/start.sh`\r\nAsk agent `send 0.001 ETH to @<twitter_username>`\r\n\r\nIn addition some adjustments may need to be made to plugin-evm that triggers the TX flow.

Added multichain support, the current version of the plugin only supported mainnet and Base, and there have been several requests for additional EVM chain support.\r\n\r\n- The plugin lacked test coverage, so we initiated tests alongside the feature development, starting with WalletProvider.\r\n- Refactored the plugin to make it more test-friendly and modular.\r\n- Added multichain support (for viem chains)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Improvements: Refactoring, cleaning, and testing of the existing plugin.\r\n- Fixes: fix transfer action\r\n- Features: Non-breaking changes to add EVM multichain support. The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup. No changes are required at this time.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## How was it tested\r\n\r\n- Ran test scripts \r\n- Verified functionality through agent interactions:\r\n<img width=\"709\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 5 58 35 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afde079e-7eaa-47cd-89df-60a93f895cd3\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nFile: packages/plugin-evm/src/tests/wallet.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nTry to add your own chain in the character and ask the agent to send some tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou",

Pull down the changes locally.\r\n2. Run the application with the updated code.\r\n3. Verify that the Twitter client no longer starts the search client by default (reducing rate limit concerns).\r\n4. Confirm that the Galadriel image model is listed and accessible as expected.\r\n5. Review logs and behavior to ensure no errors are introduced by the changes.\r\n\r\nNo special UI changes, so no screenshots required.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nDiscord username: `vi0000`\r\n",

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/1014\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nWhen the proposed tests are configured to run in CI/CD environment, they need one or more API keys which are considered as secrets. It is necessary to ensure that they are not leaked through workflows being run on behalf of malicious pull requests. In addition to restrictions on running CI/CD workflows we recommend setting up a quota on those keys, and rotating them periodically.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n1. This PR adds two basic tests:\r\n- smoke tests: checks that the project can be built and run\r\n- \"Hello Trump\": checks that the project can use one of the built-in characters (Trump) to successfully query a LLM (OpenAI).\r\n\r\nThe \"Hello Trump\" test requires OpenAI API keys to run. If the API keys are not available, this test will be skipped.\r\n\r\n2. This PR also adds initial (proof of concept) version of integration testing framework. We plan to continue development of this framework in the future as will be adding more integration tests.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThe goal of these tests is to establish a quality gate that every PR should pass at a minimum. We recommend that the tests are run at least:\r\n- on every PR before merging it\r\n- every time the main/stable branch is updated\r\n\r\nAs a policy, merges to main/stable branch should not be allowed if they would break the tests.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nThe included file `tests/README.md` describes the procedure how to set the tests up in a CI/CD environment. The API keys should be set up the repository settings under \"secrets\". When present, they will automatically be added to the .env file for the duration of the workflow.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nThis PR adds a workflow file `integrationTests.yaml` with two jobs. The reviewer should:\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3. Check output of jobs for any errors.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3. Check output of jobs for any errors.\r\n4. Adjust workflow rules to trigger workflows as desired (on pull request, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nuser98634\r\n",

Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache\n2. npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces\n3. installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation)\n\nThis can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B\n\nUsers generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it).\n\nHere, that expectation is broken\n\n### Details\n\nSee PoC.\n\nIn it, overrides from a single run of A get leaked into e.g. `~/Library/Caches/pnpm/metadata/registry.npmjs.org/rimraf.json` and persistently affect all other projects using the cache\n\n### PoC\n\nPostinstall code used in PoC is benign and can be inspected in <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ponyhooves?activeTab=code>, it's just a `console.log`\n\n1. Remove store and cache\n   On mac: `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/pnpm ~/Library/pnpm/store`\n   This step is not required in general, but we'll be using a popular package for PoC that's likely cached\n2. Create `A/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"A\",\n     \"pnpm\": { \"overrides\": { \"rimraf>glob\": \"npm:ponyhooves@1\" } },\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i --ignore-scripts` (the flag is not required, but the point of the demo is to show that it doesn't help)\n4. Create `B/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"B\",\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i`\n\nResult:\n```console\nPackages: +3\n+++\nProgress: resolved 3, reused 3, downloaded 0, added 3, done\nnode_modules/.pnpm/ponyhooves@1.0.1/node_modules/ponyhooves: Running postinstall script, done in 51ms\n\ndependencies:\n+ rimraf 6.0.1\n\nDone in 1.4s\n```\n\nAlso, that code got leaked into another project and it's lockfile now! \n\n### Impact\n\nGlobal state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs\n\nAs a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pnpm/pnpm

[#&#8203;7697](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/7697).\n-   Don't crash if the `use-node-version` setting is used and the system has no Node.js installed [#&#8203;8769](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8769).\n-   Convert settings in local `.npmrc` files to their correct types. For instance, `child-concurrency` should be a number, not a string [#&#8203;5075](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/5075).\n-   pnpm should fail if a project requires a different package manager even if `manage-package-manager-versions` is set to `true`.\n-   `pnpm init` should respect the `--dir` option [#&#8203;8768](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8768).\n\n#### Platinum

I'd like to improve the `state` to also take into account memories and previous messages so that the user can have a conversation with the agent, instead of having to pass all the information on one message. The thing is that when I've passed the whole `state` I got answers that were really related to the personality of the `character`, and I got answers that refused to help like \"I'm not here to do that\". \r\nHow can I incorporate the `state`'s memory without the personality of the `character` to gather the parameters for my `action`?"

A\r\nmain .gitignore file has already been created at the root level, which\r\ncontains all the necessary exclusions, including those for .ts files. This\r\neliminates the need for a separate .gitignore file in the agent/ folder.\r\n\r\n2- I have corrected the hardcoded path issue by replacing it with a\r\nrelative path using __dirname for better portability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n3-I understand the concern about deleting sample characters. To test our\r\nsports analysis functionality, I temporarily replaced the sample character\r\nfile but have since reverted it back. Rest assured, I have all the original\r\nsample files, including the personality you provided and the ones we tested.\r\n\r\nOn Tue, 10 Dec 2024 at 12:00, Odilitime ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n\r\n> ***@***.**** requested changes on this pull request.\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n>\r\n> On agent/.gitignore\r\n> <https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/971#discussion_r1878363005>:\r\n>\r\n> Revert or explain why this is necessary\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n>\r\n> In agent/src/services/twitter/services.ts\r\n> <https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/971#discussion_r1878369796>:\r\n>\r\n> > +// Load environment variables from .env file\r\n> +dotenv.config();\r\n> +\r\n> +// Define constants\r\n> +const BEARER_TOKEN = process.env.BEARER_TOKEN;\r\n> +const BASE_URL = \"https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent\";\r\n> +\r\n> +/**\r\n> + * Fetch recent tweets related to sports.\r\n> + * @param maxResults Number of tweets to fetch (default: 10)\r\n> + */\r\n> +\r\n> +// this function will get data from documnets for buliding custom knowledge base\r\n> +export const fetchDocuments = async (): Promise<string[]> => {\r\n> +    const pdfService = new PdfService();\r\n> +    const pdfFilePath = \"C:/Users/Dell/eliza-1/agent/src/services/twitter/game.pdf\";  //a dummy pdf\r\n>\r\n> no hard coded paths, node has __dirname if you want to give a relative\r\n> path to this file\r\n> https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#__dirname\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n>\r\n> On characters/trump.character.json\r\n> <https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/971#discussion_r1878371462>:\r\n>\r\n> I'm not sure we should be deleting our sample characters without replacing\r\n> them\r\n>\r\n> —\r\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/971#pullrequestreview-2492783366>,\r\n> or unsubscribe\r\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/A25IBTDKIAJAXDO3DUXL2E32E4FYHAVCNFSM6AAAAABTLDQIYOVHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43YUDVNRWFEZLROVSXG5CSMV3GSZLXHMZDIOJSG44DGMZWGY>\r\n> .\r\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.Message ID:\r\n> ***@***.***>\r\n>\r\n"

    "body": "Here's a PR description for the EVM plugin changes:\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR significantly enhances the EVM plugin functionality with several key improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Added core ERC-20 functionality:\r\n   - Added ERC-20 ABI and contract interactions\r\n   - Implemented token balance checking\r\n   - Added support for token transfers\r\n\r\n2. Implemented new actions:\r\n   - `getBalance`: Check ETH/token balances across chains\r\n   - `transfer`: Native token and ERC-20 transfers\r\n   - Enhanced `bridge`: Cross-chain token bridging via LiFi\r\n   - Enhanced `swap`: DEX token swaps \r\n   - via LiFi aggregation\r\n\r\n<img width=\"745\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 7 10 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed6ad6ba-6338-43d9-a234-5059f3fa144c\">\r\n\r\n3. Fixed type safety issues and improved error handling\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n- Changes to core wallet functionality could impact transaction signing\r\n- Updates to bridge/swap logic could affect cross-chain operations\r\n- ERC-20 integration adds complexity to token handling\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the core changes in:\r\n   - `src/actions/bridge.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/swap.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/transfer.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/getbalance.ts`\r\n\r\n2. Check test implementation:\r\n   - `test/setup.ts` - Test infrastructure\r\n   - `test/actions/bridge.test.ts` - Bridge action tests\r\n   - `test/providers/wallet.test.ts` - Wallet provider tests\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Test basic ETH operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n\r\n// Transfer ETH\r\nawait transferAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Test ERC-20 operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check USDC balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  chain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Bridge tokens\r\nawait bridgeAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  fromChain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  toChain: \"base\",\r\n  amount: \"100\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, documentation updates needed for:\r\n- New ERC-20 functionality\r\n- Updated action parameters\r\n- Testing setup and mocking\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n- Requires environment variables:\r\n  - `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`\r\n  - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` (optional, for token verification)\r\n- Dependencies on LiFi SDK and viem need to be properly versioned\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated to: #735",

    "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a plugin that makes Eliza verifiable through the use of TEEs. The plugin leverages the [Marlin Oyster](https://docs.marlin.org/user-guides/oyster/) platform and [SDKs](https://github.com/marlinprotocol/oyster-monorepo). More concretely, it adds an action that lets Eliza respond with remote attestations when asked. It is expected to be followed up with additional PRs for other aspects as well.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nIt's important for AI agents to be verifiable in Web3 so users can verify behaviors and responses of an agent they are interacting with. A performant way of accomplishing this is running the agent in a TEE and providing remote attestation infrastructure for verification by users. Additionally, TEEs provide privacy protections to users' interactions with agents.\r\n\r\nIt is similar in spirit to `plugin-tee` but targets the Marlin Oyster stack instead.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes. A section on the plugin has been added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nThe README of the plugin. It specifies the `.env` settings as well as how to run a mock attestation server for local testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Run the mock attestation server, simplest way is docker - `docker run --init --rm -p 1350:1350 marlinorg/attestation-server-custom-mock`\r\n2. Set configs corresponding to the plugin, just `TEE_MARLIN=yes` should suffice.\r\n3. Chat with Eliza and ask for a remote attestation, I have tried various phrasings like \"attest yourself\", \"get me a remote attestation\", etc which seem to work.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n`roshanroshan`",

Just a rename for now to reduce risk of regression. We will clean up old usages separately.\r\n\r\n# Risks  \r\n**Low**  \r\n- Existing functionality will continue to work but will display a deprecation warning.  \r\n- No impact on downstream systems expected.  \r\n- Risk is isolated to developers relying on raw text-based JSON generation.\r\n\r\n# Background  \r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?  \r\nThis PR deprecates the text-based way of generating JSON objects using LLMs and so folks use generatedObjectV2 with typesafe structured outputs. Method isn't removed yet it is deprecated.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?  \r\n- **Improvements**: Transitioning to a more robust way of handling JSON outputs.  \r\n- **Chore**: Deprecation of legacy behavior.  \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?  \r\nText-based generation of JSON using LLMs is prone to errors like missing brackets, invalid types, or inconsistent structures. Moving to a typesafe structured output guarantees that JSON complies with predefined schemas, improving both developer experience and system stability.  \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?  \r\n- **My changes require a change to the project documentation.**  \r\n- Updated docs to:  \r\n  - Reflect new structured output implementation.  \r\n  - Mark text-based generation as deprecated.  \r\n\r\n# Testing  \r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps   \r\nN/A just a rename\r\n# Deploy Notes  \r\nNo special deployment steps required. \r\n\r\n# Database changes  \r\nNone.  \r\n\r\n# Deployment instructions  \r\nStandard deployment process applies.  \r\n\r\n## Discord username  \r\n0x8664\r\n\r\n---  \r\n",

    "title": "Adding plugin for ZKsync Era",
    "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow. \r\n\r\nMain implementation risk is that the Plugin doesn't work correctly.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n[ZKsync Era](https://zksync.io/) is one of the most established ZK rollups on Ethereum. This PR implements a plugin for agents to be able to interact with Era. \r\n\r\nIn this first version, only the `transfer` function is supported. Further work will extend this functionality. \r\n\r\nMany more L2s are being build w/ the ZK Stack (the open source framework used to build ZKsync Era), and this work can be extended/modified to support these as they come online.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nWe're seeing a huge proliferation of AI agents being able to manage value on-chain. This is similar conceptually to these plugins (e.g. `plugin-solana` and others)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis plugin follows the standards set by other crypto integrations, including things like the `SEND_TOKENS` action. Changes to the overall project documentation don't seem to be required.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are in `plugin-zksync-era`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. In `.env` you should set the value for `ZKSYNC_ADDRESS` (this is the public address for the agent account) and `ZKSYNC_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key for the same account).\r\n2. To test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. Coinbase can be used to send ZK directly to an address on ZKsync Era, but I am also happy to provide tokens for reviewers (I'll send ZK tokens to reviewers that need it). \r\n3. Run the agent and prompt it with: \"send 0.5 ZK to <an address on ZKsync Era>\" - e.g. \"send 1 ZK to 0xee0c40F86544a8b0616BC827728f714a8B4cEeE7\"\r\n4. Assuming you had 1 ZK to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. `Transfer completed successfully! \"tx: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"`\r\n5. The tx hash can be checked on the ZKsync block explorer at https://explorer.zksync.io, e.g. https://explorer.zksync.io/tx/0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nanthonykrose\r\n",

    "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to easily pass secrets to the GOAT plugin as well as improve its readme.\r\n\r\nProblem: \r\nCurrenlty secrets can only be used by plugins when calling an action or a provider. If a plugin requires an initial setup such as setting up a wallet or a GOAT plugin (e.g adding Polymarket or Uniswap plugins) there is no way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nUpdate the GOAT plugin to get passed a `getSecrets` function for the specific character it is adding actions to. This allows GOAT to check the secrets/env variables and configure its plugins accordingly when being initialized.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements: This change allows developers to install GOAT plugins easily such as Polymarket, Uniswap and Coingecko. It also makes it easier to update the plugin to support multi-chain.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Go to `plugin-goat`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Make sure you have an `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` for Base set\r\n2. Comment out `evmPlugin` in `src/agent.ts`\r\n3. Run the agent and prompt it with: What's the USDC balance of `0x18Bead774f927Af586F86F6d054C269416E163DD`\r\n4. Should give you the balance of `0x18Bead774f927Af586F86F6d054C269416E163DD`\r\n\r\nTo test actions on Base Sepolia simply:\r\n1. Go to `plugin-goat/src/wallet.ts` and change\r\n```typescript\r\nconst chain = base \r\n```\r\nto\r\n```typescript\r\nconst chain = sepolia\r\n```\r\n2. Make sure `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` works for Sepolia\r\n3. Run the agent!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\naguspunk\r\n",

Added multichain support, the current version of the plugin only supported mainnet and Base, and there have been several requests for additional EVM chain support.\r\n\r\n- The plugin lacked test coverage, so we initiated tests alongside the feature development, starting with WalletProvider.\r\n- Refactored the plugin to make it more test-friendly and modular.\r\n- Added multichain support (for viem chains)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Improvements: Refactoring, cleaning, and testing of the existing plugin.\r\n- Features: Non-breaking changes to add EVM multichain support. The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility. Transfers are not yet fully functional, as noted in [Issue #735](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/735). This will be addressed in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup. No changes are required at this time.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## How was it tested\r\n\r\n- Ran test scripts \r\n- Verified functionality through agent interactions:\r\n<img width=\"627\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 2 42 13 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a99dea38-560f-46e4-8826-4e98be175486\">\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nFile: packages/plugin-evm/src/tests/wallet.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNo manual testing is required; automated tests have been implemented and cover the new functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou",

This PR focuses on enabling multichain support and making the plugin more test-friendly via TDD + a foundation to extend the plugin with more features.\n\nThe GOAT plugin does look interesting, and I’ll take a closer look to see if it aligns with the goals here.\n\nLet me know if you think it’s better to pivot entirely to GOAT, or if continuing with this plugin (and fixing the mentioned issues) is a good path forward!"

    "title": "fix: respect character config model settings",
    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nN/A - Improvement to model selection functionality\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Changes only affect how model class is selected, with fallback to default values\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nUpdates model class selection to respect character configuration settings instead of using hardcoded values. This allows characters to use different model sizes without code changes.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nBug fix (allows existing config file settings to be implemented as indicated in the [documentation](https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/docs/guides/configuration/#model-providers))\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nChanges to code line references and a README note for Apple Silicon users\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nFiles changed:\r\n1. `packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in direct message handling\r\n2. `packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts` - Updated model selection in Discord message handling\r\n3. `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in Telegram message handling\r\n4. `packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts` - Updated model selection in Farcaster interaction handling\r\n5. `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/continue.ts` - Updated model selection in continue action\r\n\r\nThe key change in each file is replacing hardcoded `ModelClass.SMALL` with:\r\n````typescript\r\nmodelClass: runtime.character.settings?.model || ModelClass.SMALL,\r\n````\r\nThis ensures consistent model selection across all client types while maintaining the small model as a fallback.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create a character config with model setting:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"model\": \"medium\",\r\n        \"temperature\": 0.45\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Start agent with character config:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --character=\"path/to/character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Verify in logs that responses use the configured model:\r\n```\r\nGenerating text with options: \r\n{\"modelProvider\":\"openai\",\"model\":\"medium\"}\r\n\r\nSelected model: \r\ngpt-4o\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Test with different model settings (\"small\", \"medium\", \"large\") to verify proper model selection\r\n\r\nFiles changed:\r\n- `packages/client-direct/src/index.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in direct message handling\r\n- `packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Discord message handling\r\n- `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` and `packages/client-telegram/src/messageManager.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Telegram message handling\r\n- `packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Farcaster interaction handling\r\n- `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/continue.ts`\r\n  - Modified model selection in CONTINUE action to use character settings\r\n  - Updated both `generateMessageResponse()` and `generateTrueOrFalse()` calls\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nStandard build process:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo database changes or special deployment instructions needed.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@seanbhart\r\n",

    "body": "<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copy and pasting relevant items out of the html comments. -->\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\nTEE Plugin\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section is to be filled out before final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nmedium\r\nThis PR should go through extra testing to ensure the Solana Plugin does not break with the addition of the TEE Plugin for key derivation and remote attestations.\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nCurrently the Solana and EVM Plugin are not aware of the TEE Plugin and a lot of custom code and configuration must be done to add deployment of Eliza agents in a TEE. This PR solves this issue by making the TEE Plugin an opt-in feature that allows developers to build a TEE compatible Eliza Agent to deploy in a Intel TDX Server running the Dstack SDK.\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds a new env variable called `TEE_MODE` with values of `OFF`, `LOCAL`, `DOCKER`, `PRODUCTION`. When the  `TEE_MODE` is set to an option other than `OFF` or `undefined` then the agent will utilize the TEE Plugin to handle wallet generations for the Solana Plugin.\r\n\r\nEvery time a key is derived to generate a wallet in the Solana Plugin the following happens:\r\n- Derives an ed25519 key based on the value of the `WALLET_SECRET_SALT`\r\n- Generates a Remote Attestation Quote with the `reportdata` that includes a JSON string of `{agentId: ${agentId}, publicKey: ${publicKey}}`\r\n- In the logs, a user can take the RA Quote and the `reportdata` to verify publicly at https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ \r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeature\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation. There will be another step in this PR to add documentation within the advanced section to step developers through setting up their Eliza Agent to be TEE compatible. This documentation will take developers through the process of\r\n- Building an Agent locally with TEE_MODE enabled\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a locally deployed Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a docker container of the Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the Eliza Agent within a Real TEE via Phala Network's Dstack Dashboard\r\n- How to verify a Remote Attestation on https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ and validate the `reportdata` passed into the RA Quote\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nRun through existing Solana Plugin tests before merge.\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nA reviewer should start by running the existing codebase with `TEE_MODE` set to `OFF` to ensure functionality hasn't broken.\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n- Run existing test sets that have TEE_MODE set `OFF` or `undefined` and pass all tests\r\n- Set `TEE_MODE` to `LOCAL` and run through a local test by launching the docker TEE Simulator then building and starting the project on the development machine where the docker TEE Simulator is running \r\n- Set `TEE_MODE` to `DOCKER` and run through a docker test by launching the docker TEE Simulator then building a docker image on a `linux/amd64` platform where the docker TEE Simulator is running\r\n- (Optional: I can record a start from scratch video) Set `TEE_MODE` to `PRODUCTION` and run through a production deployment by launching in an Intel TDX Server with Dstack SDK setup to deploy via a dashboard\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

Review the `getCloudflareGatewayBaseURL` function in `generation.ts`\r\n2. Check gateway integration in provider handlers\r\n3. Verify documentation clarity in `configuration.md`\r\n\r\n### Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure Cloudflare AI Gateway:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_GW_ENABLED=true\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_AI_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_ID=your-gateway-id\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Test with different providers:\r\n   - Verify OpenAI requests route through gateway\r\n   - Verify Anthropic requests route through gateway\r\n   - Verify Groq requests route through gateway\r\n\r\n3. Test fallback behavior:\r\n   - Disable gateway and verify direct API calls\r\n   - Use invalid configuration and verify fallback\r\n   - Check logging messages for debugging info\r\n\r\n### Expected Results\r\n- When gateway is properly configured:\r\n  - Requests route through Cloudflare\r\n  - Logs show gateway URL being used\r\n  - Response handling remains unchanged\r\n\r\n- When gateway is disabled/misconfigured:\r\n  - Fallback to direct API calls\r\n  - Warning logs indicate configuration issues\r\n  - Service continues to function normally\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nw3_bounty",

This was implemented originally by @oberlinstands and probably had a different dev workflow bc the eliza was not built and only the packages were installed. This is why the `/dev/null` may have been required bc the dev needed to build eliza then `pnpm start` inside the container.\r\n\r\nIn the package.json file we can see `pnpm docker` will execute this script for all 3 docker commands `build`, `run` and `bash`.  \r\n```\r\n\"docker:build\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh build\",\r\n\"docker:run\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh run\",\r\n\"docker:bash\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh bash\",\r\n\"docker:start\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh start\",\r\n\"docker\": \"pnpm docker:build && pnpm docker:run && pnpm docker:bash\",\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/438c1f1400e365510cae9c19dfc35ca4f663512d/package.json#L20C10-L20C78\r\n\r\nIf checking the `docker run` script, we can see that the command is executed based on this logic\r\n```\r\n # Start building the docker run command\r\nCMD=\"docker run --platform linux/amd64 -p 3000:3000 -d\"\r\n\r\n# Add base mounts\r\nfor mount in \"${BASE_MOUNTS[@]}\"; do\r\n   CMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/$mount\\\"\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Add package mounts\r\nfor package in \"${PACKAGES[@]}\"; do\r\n   CMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/packages/$package/src:/app/packages/$package/src\\\"\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Add core types mount separately (special case)\r\nCMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/packages/core/types:/app/packages/core/types\\\"\"\r\n\r\n# Add container name and image\r\nCMD=\"$CMD --name eliza eliza\"\r\n\r\n# Execute the command\r\neval $CMD\r\n;;\r\n ```\r\n \r\nFor the last command `docker bash`, then we see that this. may be the culprit since it will try run \r\n```\r\n# Check if the container is running before executing bash\r\nif [ \"$(docker ps -q -f name=eliza)\" ]; then\r\n   docker exec -it eliza bash\r\nelse\r\n   echo \"Container 'eliza' is not running. Please start it first.\"\r\n   exit 1\r\nfi\r\n;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run a test on `pnpm docker`, I will see this result:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3596cc8b-12ae-452c-bb7c-1fdf648c8ccc)\r\n\r\nI think the change we are looking for is to remove bash command from the `pnpm docker` package script & let the docker image be built and run. If there are errors whenever this happens, then execute pnpm docker:bash to debug the docker image & find out what the problems are."
