List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nFor a production ready - multi-character Eliza setup, we want to load new characters in runtime via API calls.\r\nWe do not want to restart the Eliza server for each new character.\r\n\r\n_ASSUMPTION:_ \r\nAn api or script exists to store the characters in DB.\r\nThe api uses the same stringToUUID method to create consistent UUIDs for a character and store in DB.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- Allows loading characters from DB during start\r\n- Allows loading characters via REST API from DB during runtime\r\n- The characters are stored in TEXT/JSONB format - similar to the character Agent file in sqlite and postgres respectively\r\n- Securely encrypts each character's secrets using AES-256 encryption and then stores in DB (Decrypt after fetch)\r\n- Proper error handling for all scenarios \r\n    - Character already loaded in runtime\r\n    - Character does not exist in db\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nThis is a new Feature\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\nCurrently \r\n1) For adding any new agent, we need to restart the Eliza server => All the agents and its clients are loaded again - All previous tweets (incase of twitter client), interactions are processed again. Any existing direct or telegram conversation is lost. \r\n2) Not a straight-forward mechanism to add new agents - Now with a REST API - load new agents.\r\n\r\nWhy are we doing this?\r\nTo take a step towards multi-character production setup\r\n\r\n### Code Changes made and why?\r\n1. **Created a new table in postgres and sqlite** - Added in the seed file/script of both DBs\r\n`\r\nexport type CharacterTable = {\r\n    id: UUID;                                                // created from stringToUUID - unique and consistent for name\r\n    name: string;\r\n    characterState: Character;                 // A JSONB or TEXT - that maps the character\r\n    secretsIV?: Secrets;                            // Initialisation Vector for each secrets\r\n};\r\n`\r\n**Also added the above in packages/core/src/types.ts**\r\n2. **in SqliteAdapter and PostgresAdapter** - created a new function to load from this characters table\r\n3. **in Agents/src/index.ts** -> \r\n- Assign Directclient to a global variable - along with set and get methods. This is to allow the same direct client be used for character(agent) runtime creation\r\n- A function loadCharactersFromDb loadCharactersFromDb(\r\n                            characterNames?: string\r\n                        ): Promise<Character[]> \r\n    - if any characterNames argument received, it fetches only those characters from db\r\n    - else fetches all characters\r\n    - This handles encryption and decryption of secrets if secrets are present in a character\r\n    - uses env.ENCRYPTION_KEY\r\n- An express server\r\n   - The server starts only when the env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT == true\r\n   - _Why not use the same express server in DirectClient?_ DirectClient does not have access to the DB methods and all the agent-specific handling methods\r\n   - ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - PORT: default. - 3001, overwritten by env AGENT_PORT\r\n4. **in packages/client-direct/src/index.ts**\r\n- Added ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - This endpoint (is a proxy) that routes request to the agent server's route\r\n   -    Before proxying, checks if AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT  ==true and if agents already in runtime\r\n5. created a file **packages/core/src/crypt.ts**\r\n- This handles the encryption and decryption methods\r\n6. created scripts that parses a character json file or all files in a folder and inserts in DB\r\n- Location: scripts/importCharactersInDB/[postgres/sqlite]/insertInDb.js\r\nRequires env variable\r\n`\r\nPOSTGRES_URL= # if postgres\r\nENCRYPTION_KEY=\"\"\r\nINPUT_PATH=characters # the folder path to load the characters from\r\nSQLITE_DB_PATH= #if you want to change db path Default: agent/data/db.sqlite\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

Fetching from database during start\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=true\r\n- `pnpm start`\r\n- Will function as usual\r\n- if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n2. Loading an agent during runtime\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=false #if true, we can't test load as all characters in db will be loaded\r\n- set env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT=true\r\n- set env ENCRYPTION_KEY= #use the same encryption key used in insertInDB.js script\r\n- set env AGENT_PORT=4000 #can be empty if we want to pick default port 3001\r\n`pnpm start`\r\n- This will load with the default character Eliza\r\n- `curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/load/trump'` - replace port and character name if using different characters\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 1: agent is loaded and we get success code 200\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 2: agent is already loaded and we get error code 409\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 3: agent does not exist in db and we get error code 404\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 4:  Error during agent load - like incorrect twitter - error code 500\r\n-  if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automtated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

The implementation provides a reusable and scalable solution for caching data in the application by also implementing the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n\r\n**Implemented Features:**\r\n- `getCache`: Retrieves cached data for a given `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `setCache`: Caches data with a unique key constructed using `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `deleteCache`: Removes cached data for the specified `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- Proper error handling and logging for all Redis operations.\r\n- Integration with the `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` interface.\r\n\r\n**Code Highlights:**\r\n- A new `RedisClient` class implements the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n- The `buildKey` method ensures unique Redis keys for each agent and operation.\r\n- `ioredis` is used for efficient Redis interactions, supporting advanced Redis features like clusters and pipelines if needed in the future.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Provides a scalable and reusable caching solution.\r\n- Ensures clear separation of concerns and adheres to the existing interface.\r\n- Improves application performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe implementation has been tested for the following scenarios:\r\n- Successfully setting a cache entry.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that exists.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that does not exist.\r\n- Deleting a cache entry.\r\n- Handling Redis errors gracefully during operations.\r\n",

The implementation provides a reusable and scalable solution for caching data in the application by also implementing the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n\r\n**Implemented Features:**\r\n- `getCache`: Retrieves cached data for a given `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `setCache`: Caches data with a unique key constructed using `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `deleteCache`: Removes cached data for the specified `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- Proper error handling and logging for all Redis operations.\r\n- Integration with the `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` interface.\r\n\r\n**Code Highlights:**\r\n- A new `RedisClient` class implements the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n- The `buildKey` method ensures unique Redis keys for each agent and operation.\r\n- `ioredis` is used for efficient Redis interactions, supporting advanced Redis features like clusters and pipelines if needed in the future.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Provides a scalable and reusable caching solution.\r\n- Ensures clear separation of concerns and adheres to the existing interface.\r\n- Improves application performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe implementation has been tested for the following scenarios:\r\n- Successfully setting a cache entry.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that exists.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that does not exist.\r\n- Deleting a cache entry.\r\n- Handling Redis errors gracefully during operations.\r\n",

This will also enable autonomous agent to unify all input and outputs into a single stream of thought and action.\r\n\r\n* Unified agent wallet\r\nThe current wallet system reflects the way we use humans use wallets today, but the UX around network switching and wallet management is a pain. Instead, the agent will have a unified wallet, with access to all registered chains at once. No wallet switching, and tokens will all be handled by agents in a unified way.\r\n\r\n* CLI Tool\r\nWe want a create-react-app like experience for creating new projects, and we want CLI handlers for adding and removing plugins, opening chat interface in browser, maybe even deploying like Cloudflare Wrangler to some of our deployment provider friends. Should also handle secrets management and character / agent / conversation management.\r\n\r\n* Model Provider Registry\r\nThe current model provider system requires a pull request to core for every model provider. v2 will have a registry and override pattern so new code doesn't need to be added to core, and any provider can quickly override with a few lines of code to add integration without a pull request.\r\n\r\n* Extensible and generic core framework\r\nThe v1 is very opinionated about prompts, state and some features. v2 will be very extensible so you can create different kinds of agents and override state management and context composition. For advanced developers, this will make the framework far more powerful and flexible for different user cases.\r\n\r\n* Community plugins\r\nWe'll be moving community plugins out of core and adding requirements for plugin inclusion in core around test coverage, documentation and code maintenance and ownership.\r\n\r\n* Better secret management\r\nCurrently, secret management in .env and character files is risky, so considering better and more secure options for this\r\n\r\n* 100% Test Coverage\r\nv2 reflects what we want Eliza to be, and we feel that after these changes we should focus entirely on stability, security and cutting down on issues. We'll be aiming for 100% test coverage of core, adapters and primary components, and end-to-end tests for clients.",

But more broadly, the agent should have a single wallet and a wallet abstraction, and probably event hooks for providing data and getting data from many different wallets.\r\n\r\nWe should think about wallets and how we manage plugin dependencies.",

The agent would respond to the same message multiple time due to the continue trigger.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nTest sending a message, watch logs for CONTINUE message to be triggered, watch logs as agent logs that a response has already been sent to an existing message or not responding further.\r\n\r\nThe double response was seen as triggered in a CONTINUE action whe the agent would ask/frame response a certain way back to the user. Which on subsequent messages, would trigger the callback to respond to the same message multiple times.\r\n\r\nWhere the continue action is meant for a natural flow of thoughts to keep generating, on normal back and forth convo's it would duplicate response.\r\n\r\nFix below now stops that as it takes into consideration its own message it just responded to, and how it framed to either not respond again, or continue a thought as it was intended.\r\n\r\n---TESTING Screen Record---\r\n1st section shows a previous double response, which is triggered by the question the agent asked to the user, which in turn triggers a double response on the next reply from the user\r\n\r\n2nd section shows continue being triggered as normal, but not triggering another response in the handler callback since it already responded. This will still allow continue to allow the agent to \"continue\" a thought it had as it was intended, also, per the examples.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ed92c8f-dc99-4c3b-95fc-9c0052f56197\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nninja_dev\r\n",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, maintaining comprehensive JSDoc documentation across our TypeScript codebase is a manual and time-consuming process. This leads to inconsistent documentation coverage and puts an unnecessary burden on developers. We need an automated solution that can help generate and maintain JSDoc comments while ensuring high quality and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nPropose a two-phase approach:\r\n\r\n1. Manual Documentation Phase:\r\n   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript files\r\n   - Include documentation for functions, classes, interfaces, and other code blocks\r\n\r\n2. Automation Implementation:\r\n   - Develop an LLM-based automation solution for generating JSDoc comments\r\n   - Integrate the automation into our CI/CD pipeline (like when a PR for a new feat is merged)\r\n   - Create a manual trigger mechanism for the automation process\r\n\r\n**Create a GitHub Actions workflow/AI agent that:**\r\n\r\n1. Automated Documentation Generation:\r\n   - Triggers on demand (via workflow_dispatch) or when specific files change\r\n   - Scans TypeScript files that lack JSDoc documentation\r\n   - Uses an AI service (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate contextually accurate JSDoc comments\r\n   - Maintains existing JSDoc comments and only adds missing ones\r\n\r\n2. Quality Control:\r\n   - Follows our existing JSDoc standards and TypeDoc configuration\r\n   - Validates generated comments for completeness and accuracy\r\n   - Ensures proper documentation of parameters, return types, and function descriptions\r\n\r\n3. Pull Request Management:\r\n   - Creates a new branch for documentation updates\r\n   - Generates a pull request with the changes\r\n   - Adds appropriate labels (e.g., 'documentation', 'automated')\r\n   - Includes a detailed PR description explaining the changes\r\n   - Assigns relevant reviewers\r\n\r\n4. Configuration:\r\n   - Allows customization of AI prompt templates\r\n   - Provides options to include/exclude specific files or directories\r\n   - Configurable commit message and PR templates\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Manual documentation enforcement through PR checks\r\n2. Using existing JSDoc generation tools like https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc\r\n3. Implementing stricter code review policies for documentation\r\n4. Creating documentation sprints for batch updates\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRequired Permissions and Secrets:\r\n- GitHub token with PR creation permissions\r\n- AI service API key (e.g., OpenAI)\r\n- Repository write access for branch creation\r\n\r\n### Additional Motivation\r\n\r\nThis could be a proof of concept AI junior dev Karpathy talks about\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c3c68f-d85a-414c-a26f-231bd6ecb831)\r\n\r\n",

We will clean up old usages separately.\r\n\r\n# Risks  \r\n**Low**  \r\n- Existing functionality will continue to work but will display a deprecation warning.  \r\n- No impact on downstream systems expected.  \r\n- Risk is isolated to developers relying on raw text-based JSON generation.\r\n\r\n# Background  \r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?  \r\nThis PR deprecates the text-based way of generating JSON objects using LLMs and so folks use generatedObjectV2 with typesafe structured outputs. Method isn't removed yet it is deprecated.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?  \r\n- **Improvements**: Transitioning to a more robust way of handling JSON outputs.  \r\n- **Chore**: Deprecation of legacy behavior.  \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?  \r\nText-based generation of JSON using LLMs is prone to errors like missing brackets, invalid types, or inconsistent structures. Moving to a typesafe structured output guarantees that JSON complies with predefined schemas, improving both developer experience and system stability.  \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?  \r\n- **My changes require a change to the project documentation.**  \r\n- Updated docs to:  \r\n  - Reflect new structured output implementation.  \r\n  - Mark text-based generation as deprecated.  \r\n\r\n# Testing  \r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps   \r\nN/A just a rename\r\n# Deploy Notes  \r\nNo special deployment steps required. \r\n\r\n# Database changes  \r\nNone.  \r\n\r\n# Deployment instructions  \r\nStandard deployment process applies.  \r\n\r\n## Discord username  \r\n0x8664\r\n\r\n---  \r\n",

We updated the .npmrc default to set frozen-lockfile=true and in order to update the lockfile when you add a new dependency in your package.json or bump a version in your package.json you need to explicitly call pnpm i --no-frozen-lockfile \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Improvements**: This change improves the dependency management process by enforcing the use of a consistent lock file during installations.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

See this branch: [jure/fix-workflows-and-docs](https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/tree/jure/fix-workflows-and-docs). I even went so far to try to update Chinese etc. READMEs, which is of course complete nonsense since I don't even understand what is written there. Furthermore, there are scripts that use `pnpm install` that I cannot really test, and since it they are undocumented it's impossible to tell if they should be changed or not.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had a thought to update all references to `pnpm install`, but I changed my mind because it's not a black/white decision. People need to understand how lockfiles work, and if they are not using them properly it is not our ability (or responsibility) to educate them. The issues we're seeing today with lockfiles are the result of (1) `npm` / `pnpm`'s design decision (or rather, a change of), and (2) carelesness.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution therefore boils down to PR reviewers. In particular:\r\n- The `main` and `develop` branches should always be \"stable\", i.e. having passing tests\r\n- Whenever a PR introduces a change that causes tests to fail, it should not be merged until the cause of failure is established and corrected.\r\n\r\nThat said, the tests can fail for more than lockfile being out of sync, and we should probably focus on making them work in a reliable way. One of key issues is that our tests depend on external things such as OpenAI and API keys. I would recommend adding a separate smoke test just for OpenAI (a simple `curl` command)."

This behavior can cause unexpected issues when deploying or running the application, as the installed packages may not match the versions specified in the lock file.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository.\r\n2. Run the command `pnpm install` without the `--frozen-lockfile` option.\r\n3. Observe that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is updated with new versions of dependencies, even if they are not specified in the `package.json`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe `pnpm install` command should respect the `--frozen-lockfile` option, preventing any updates to the lock file. This ensures that the installed dependencies match the versions specified in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, maintaining consistency across different environments.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue was addressed in a recent commit that added the `--frozen-lockfile` option to various installation commands in the project, including in the GitHub workflows, Dockerfile, and scripts. The explicit update script was also introduced to allow updates without the frozen lock file option, ensuring that developers can manage dependencies more effectively without risking unintended changes to the lock file.",

Manually labeling each pull request based on the files changed or branch names is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays in reviews and potential contributor frustration.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nImplementing an automated labeling system using GitHub Actions, specifically the `actions/labeler` action, would streamline this process. By configuring a `.github/labeler.yml` file, we can define rules that automatically apply labels to pull requests based on criteria such as modified file paths or branch naming conventions. This automation ensures consistent labeling, accelerates the triage process, and allows maintainers to focus on meaningful code reviews.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- **Manual Labeling**: Continuing to label pull requests by hand, which is inefficient and susceptible to human error.\r\n\r\n- **Custom Scripts**: Developing bespoke scripts to handle labeling, which would require additional maintenance and might not integrate seamlessly with GitHub's ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nAutomated labeling enhances the contributor experience by providing immediate feedback on the categorization of their pull requests. It also aids in project management by ensuring that all contributions are appropriately tagged, facilitating better tracking and prioritization. Implementing this feature aligns with best practices for open-source project maintenance, promoting efficiency and encouraging more streamlined collaboration.\r\n\r\nFor more information on setting up the labeler action, refer to the official GitHub documentation:  ",

Over time, some of these become inactive or outdated, cluttering the repository and making it challenging to identify current and relevant items. Manually tracking and closing such inactive issues and pull requests is time-consuming and prone to oversight.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nImplementing an automated workflow using the `actions/stale` GitHub Action can streamline this process. This action would automatically mark issues and pull requests as stale after a specified period of inactivity and subsequently close them if no further activity occurs. This automation ensures that the repository remains organized, with outdated or inactive items systematically managed.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- **Manual Management**: Regularly reviewing and closing inactive issues and pull requests by hand. However, this approach is labor-intensive and may lead to inconsistencies or delays in addressing stale items.\r\n\r\n- **Custom Scripts**: Developing bespoke scripts to handle stale issues and pull requests. While feasible, this requires additional maintenance and may not be as robust or feature-rich as existing solutions like `actions/stale`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe `actions/stale` GitHub Action is a widely used tool for managing inactive issues and pull requests. It allows for customization of inactivity periods, messages, and labels, providing flexibility to adapt to the project's specific needs. Implementing this action can improve project maintenance efficiency and enhance contributor engagement by clearly indicating which items require attention.\r\n\r\nFor more information and configuration options, refer to the official `actions/stale` documentation:\r\n\r\n ",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nBuild failure in `@elizaos/eliza package` due to unresolved dependency `@elizaos/plugin-image-generation`. The build process fails when attempting to resolve the image generation plugin import in `defaultCharacter.ts`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- 1. Clone the eliza repository (v0.1.5-alpha.5)\r\n- 2. Import and add the `imageGenerationPlugin` to Eliza in `defaultCharacter.ts`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\nimport { imageGenerationPlugin } from \"@elizaos/plugin-image-generation\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [imageGenerationPlugin],\r\n```\r\n- 3. Run `pnpm build` in the project root\r\n- 4. Build fails with error message indicating it cannot resolve \"@elizaos/plugin-image-generation\" in defaultCharacter.ts\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe build process should successfully compile all packages including @elizaos/eliza. The @elizaos/plugin-image-generation package should be properly resolved as it's listed in the workspace packages.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- Project version: v0.1.5-alpha.\r\n- Build tool: turbo 2.3.3\r\n- Package manager: pnpm\r\n- The package @elizaos/plugin-image-generation is listed in the workspace scope but fails to resolve during build\r\n- Error occurs in the ESM build step using tsup\r\n- File causing error: packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts\r\n\r\n\r\n**Exact error:**\r\n```sh\r\nUSER@MACHINE MINGW64

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using the Eliza framework, I successfully configured the Twitter client and logged into my account. However, upon inspecting the runtime logs, I noticed that the message `[\"\u25ce Next tweet scheduled in 128 minutes\"] ` appeared twice. This indicates that `generateNewTweetLoop` was called twice, resulting in two independent tweet scheduling loops being initialized.\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs because the `start` method in `/packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts` calls `generateNewTweetLoop` twice\u2014once at line 174 and again at line 190\u2014without any conditional checks to prevent multiple timers.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Add the following code to the relevant `character.json` file:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   \"clients\": [\"twitter\"]\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Configure the Twitter-related parameters in the `.env` file, and set `POST_IMMEDIATELY=true` to enable immediate tweet posting.\r\n\r\n3. Start the model service.\r\n\r\n4. Check Twitter, and you will find that two tweets are posted simultaneously. Additionally, the logs show the message `Next tweet scheduled in xxx minutes` printed twice.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe generateNewTweetLoop method should only be invoked once during the start method, ensuring that only a single tweet scheduling loop is active. This would prevent duplicate logs and redundant scheduling timers.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"833\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ebe87aa-ff46-488d-9961-90daf43b5aab\" />\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- File: /packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts\r\n- Method: start\r\n- Lines: 174 and 190\r\n- Observed Behavior: generateNewTweetLoop is called twice without a conditional check, causing two scheduling loops to be initialized.\r\n- Move second generateNewTweetLoop() inside the if (enableActionProcessing)",

            "body": "Title: Standardize boolean values and fix pattern for .env file\r\n\r\nDescribe the bug\r\nThe `.env` file contains some inconsistencies in how boolean values and specific strings are represented. For instance, the variable `POST_IMMEDIATELY` uses the string \"NO\", while a boolean value like `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE` uses `false`. This inconsistency could lead to parsing issues and is prone to human error. \r\n\r\nTo Reproduce\r\n1. Open the `.env` file. 2. Observe that `POST_IMMEDIATELY=NO` is used instead of the expected `false`. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n Boolean variables should consistently use `true` or `false`, and all string-based boolean values such as `POST_IMMEDIATELY` should use `true`/`false` instead of `\"YES\"`/`\"NO\"`. \r\n\r\nAdditional context\r\n This change will standardize boolean values, making the `.env` file easier to parse and reducing the risk of errors. The `parseBooleanFromText` function, declared as `const parseBooleanFromText: (text: string) => boolean;`, can be used outside the `.env` context to ensure boolean parsing is consistent across the codebase. \r\n\r\nGuidelines for .env values\r\n\r\n1. **Boolean values**: Always use `true` or `false` (not `\"YES\"` or `\"NO\"`). \r\nExample: ``` TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true POST_IMMEDIATELY=false ``` \r\n\r\n Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and make it easier for automated scripts to process the `.env` file while reduce  human error.",

But tested with clearing cache and cached, working great.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the .env variable TWITTER_COOKIES and simply uses twitterScraper to manage cookies on login better from cache.\r\n\r\nIt also removes the docs / readme step where user has to provide the JSON array of TWITTER_COOKIES.\r\n\r\nSide win: the looping try-catch while loop is cleaner to read, deleted many lines of code in simpler implementation for twitter auth.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nTWITTER_COOKIES env var is an added complexity not required, users have to go searching in dev-tools console `document.cookie` and rearrange their JSON and add to ENV. But, twitter-scraper client has support for login + fetch current cookies on it's own. It is a redundant ENV setup that can be removed to simplify the twitter agent setup process for all users.\r\n\r\nI recently implemented twitter-scapper-client in my own custom agent and never had todo this ENV setup, I saw it as a EZ win for Eliza community to port over.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have removed the TWITTER_COOKIES docs sections, full deletion, no longer needed.\r\n\r\nPlease show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba2b848b-2c47-4ba7-a3ca-7f3fa8172129)\r\n\r\nI also ran:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn await this.runtime.cacheManager.delete(\r\n    `twitter/${username}/cookies`\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo delete the cookies from cache manually to verify my code was working.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nRemove TWITTER_COOKIES from .env and see if Twitter agent boots correctly and works from fresh cache and already cached.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNone, automated tests are fine. \r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nRemove TWITTER_COOKIES from any CI / CD and .env test runners.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\ncjft\r\n",

Make the AgenRuntime constructor private and create a static factory function that is async and accepts `ReadonlyArray<Plugin | DynamicPlugin>` as a parameter. Await the dynamic parameters in the async static factory. Bonus points for adding `_tag: 'Plugin'` and `_tag: 'DynamicPlugin` to the respective types, although this would be a high impact change since it would fuck over downstream plugins.\r\n> \r\n> I see, more complex with types then I originally thought, will think about / work on, thanks for feedback.\r\n\r\nActually I stand mistaken since there is a `filter(Boolean)` and the end the nulls get filtered out.

Please describe.**\r\nour current implementation lacks support for azure's suite of models, which limits our ability to fully utilize their ecosystem. this creates challenges when integrating with organizations heavily invested in azure for their infrastructure and services. without support for azure models, we're unable to offer flexibility to teams looking to standardize their ai deployments within azure environments.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd support for all azure models across our platform. this includes providing seamless integration for model hosting, training, and inferencing via azure's api and tools. users should be able to deploy and manage models using azure's ecosystem with the same ease and functionality offered for other supported providers.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nrelying on third-party middleware or custom solutions to bridge the gap between our platform and azure's services. however, these are often cumbersome and introduce maintenance overhead.\r\ncontinuing to use existing supported providers exclusively, but this limits our ability to work with azure-focused organizations and may push potential users away.\r\ndeveloping an entirely separate module for azure models, though this could lead to fragmentation in our feature set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nazure is one of the leading cloud platforms, with a growing presence in the ai and ml space. support for azure models would unlock access to their advanced tools like azure machine learning, cognitive services, and integration with microsoft products. this would make our platform more appealing to enterprise customers already using azure for their cloud infrastructure. this could start out as just support for openai in azure but you can imagine how powerful the azure apis could be for using [all of the supported models](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)",

I suggest trying to do use the following to test it locally: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Description: \u201cact\u201d is a command-line utility written in Go that lets you run your GitHub Actions workflows locally.\r\n\u2022 How It Works: It parses your workflow .yml files and simulates GitHub Actions events (push, pull_request, etc.) in Docker containers on your local machine.\r\n\u2022 Why It\u2019s Good:\r\n\r\nGreat for quickly iterating on a workflow without having to push to a branch repeatedly.\r\nLets you see console output, debug logs, and environment variables as if you were running on GitHub.\r\n\u2022 Potential Drawbacks:\r\nNot all GitHub Actions are guaranteed to work seamlessly. Some might rely on GitHub-hosted runners or environment specifics that \u201cact\u201d may not perfectly replicate.\r\nYou need Docker installed locally.\r\n\u2022 How to Get Started Quickly:\r\nInstall Docker.\r\nInstall act (on macOS you can use Homebrew: brew install act, or grab the binary from the GitHub releases page).\r\nFrom your repository, run:\r\nact <event_name>\r\nFor example, act push or act pull_request.\r\nBy default, act uses a lightweight Docker image for its runner; for more complex workflows you might need:\r\nact <event_name> --medium or --workflows .github/workflows/<your_workflow.yml>\r\n"

This change aims to reduce off-topic interactions and ensure more focused, character-appropriate engagement. There had been many complaints about the bot being too active, prompting this shift to a more restrictive standard.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\nUpdated engagement guidelines with more specific filtering criteria\r\nRaised quality thresholds for all action types (LIKE, RETWEET, QUOTE, REPLY)\r\nAdded explicit skip conditions for:\r\nOff-topic/tangentially related content\r\nHigh-profile accounts unless explicitly relevant\r\nGeneric/viral content\r\nPolitical/controversial content\r\nPromotional content\r\nModified action thresholds to require near-perfect relevance (9.5-9.8/10)\r\nAdded default behavior to skip actions unless extremely confident\r\n\r\n# Type of change\r\n[x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n[ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n[ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n[ ] Verified stricter filtering with test prompts\r\n[ ] Confirmed higher quality thresholds are enforced\r\n[ ] Tested default no-action behavior\r\n\r\nRelated Issues\r\nAddresses issue with off-topic interactions and excessive posting frequency",

            "body": "This is my first attempt to contribute to this project. I have been adding features and additional query capability for the Birdeye API and I think many other could benefit.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\n- plugin ecosystem and capabilities for accessing and querying Birdeye data API\r\n- [Expanding Birdeye thread](https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1318974518680748173)\r\n- possible overlap with: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1366\r\n\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- People who already have the BIRDEYE_API_KEY enabled could end up querying the endpoints more\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nThis pull request significantly enhances the Birdeye API integration within the AI agent framework by expanding its capabilities beyond basic query functionality. The proposed tools enable more comprehensive and versatile interactions with the Birdeye API, including data clearing and management features. These improvements provide the AI agents with a broader and more efficient toolkit for handling Birdeye API data, enhancing the overall flexibility and utility of the framework for developers and end-users. By extending the scope of the API integration, this contribution supports more robust and scalable solutions within the project.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds providers that represent all the different API endpoints available in the Birdeye API. By doing so, it ensures that when a user requests a specific type of data, the AI agent has a significantly higher likelihood of accessing and utilizing the relevant data in its response. This enhancement maximizes the agent\u2019s ability to provide accurate and contextually rich answers, leveraging the full scope of the Birdeye API.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- net new plugin\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis API connection is critical for enabling the agent to perform research and analyze the dynamics of the ecosystem effectively. By integrating comprehensive access to all Birdeye API endpoints, this PR lays the groundwork for future enhancements and features that will further expand the agent's capabilities. This integration not only empowers the agent to deliver more insightful and accurate responses but also positions the framework for scalable growth and the addition of advanced functionalities in the future.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a document change is needed, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Yes, this will require the docs to be updated.

The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the integration of the `fereai-provider` in the `package.json` and the configuration of the required environment variables. Then, examine the updates made to `packages/core/src/generation.ts`, `packages/core/src/models.ts`, `packages/core/src/types.ts` and the `agent/src/index.ts` handlers under API configurations to understand the response handling.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables**:  \r\n   - Ensure that `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` are correctly set in the environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Run `pnpm add` to install the new `fereai-provider` module.\r\n\r\n3. **Run Unit Tests**:  \r\n   - Execute the `fereai-provider` test suite to verify that all existing and new tests pass successfully.\r\n   - For `fereai-provider` tests, refer to the [fereai-provider tests](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider/blob/main/packages/fereai/src/fereai.test.ts).\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing**:  \r\n   - Interact with the chatbot to ensure that responses are handled correctly and that the integration with FereAI APIs functions as expected using `fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Monitor logs to confirm that structured logging is operational and that no errors related to the new integration occur.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

While there are translations for several other languages, Filipino developers cannot read the documentation in their native language. This is particularly important as it will improve accessibility and inclusivity for the growing tech community in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Tagalog translation of the main README.md as README_TG.md, including:\r\n- Full translation of all sections, including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines\r\n- Proper formatting to ensure readability\r\n- Addition of Tagalog (Tagalog) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\n- Maintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) \u2013 inadequate because automated translations may not accurately capture technical terms and nuances in Tagalog.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nTagalog is spoken by millions of Filipinos and is one of the primary languages in the Philippines.\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format).\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Filipino developer community.\r\n",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8. Please let me know if anything is broke when you test it, it worked well on my end.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1.

When requesting an image generation observe that the code selects FAL_API_KEY instead of VENICE_API_KEY.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf a specific imageModelProvider is set, the code should return the matching API key for that provider if it exists.

If that is not present, it will proceed down the fallback chain. This ensures that if an an image model api key is set, it is correctly chosen over other existing keys which are higher in the selection list, like FAL_API_KEY.\r\n\r\nPS: Solution is implemented and tested, creating bug report for tracked pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If no specific provider key is found, the code should then try the fallback chain in sequence.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c086855-48b3-42ba-b410-6f87c2513711)\r\n\r\n**Fix** \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c59fae1b-652c-41e1-9540-fa2c2a85cba7)\r\n\r\n`const apiKey =\r\n    runtime.imageModelProvider === runtime.modelProvider\r\n        ? runtime.token\r\n        : (() => {\r\n            // First try to match the specific provider\r\n            switch (runtime.imageModelProvider) {\r\n                case ModelProviderName.HEURIST:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.TOGETHER:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.FAL:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.OPENAI:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.VENICE:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n                default:\r\n                    // If no specific match, try the fallback chain\r\n                    return (runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n            }\r\n        })();`\r\n\r\nThis fix updates the logic to first attempt to retrieve the API key from the specifically selected imageModelProvider. If that is not present, it will proceed down the fallback chain. This ensures that if an an image model api key is set, it is correctly chosen over other existing keys which are higher in the selection list, like FAL_API_KEY.\r\n\r\nPS: Solution is implemented and tested, creating bug report for tracked pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "**Description**\r\nAdding a new type of \u201cswarm agent\u201d to the Eliza framework. The goal is to allow multiple agents to coordinate on tasks in a way similar to how single-character agents are currently configured, while supporting unique swarm features such as collective decision-making and interactions among multiple agents.\r\n\r\n**Motivation & Rationale**\r\n\r\nEliza currently supports single \u201ccharacter\u201d agents with various providers, settings, and behaviours.\r\nA natural next step is to introduce the ability for multiple agents to work collectively (swarm) on tasks.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Feature Requirements**\r\n\r\n1. Swarm Agent Configuration\r\n\r\n_Support a dedicated configuration block for swarm agents in a manner similar to single-character agents._\r\n\r\n Allow specifying:\r\n- Number of agents in the swarm.\r\n- Provider definitions for each agent (could be the same or different).\r\n- Traditional settings (e.g., roles, personas, capabilities).\r\n- Additional swarm-specific settings (e.g., rules for agent coordination, speaker settings, collective decision-making thresholds).`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Create Swarm Logic.\r\n\r\n- Configure and Execute swarms by importing the core package in external projects.\r\n- Allow all supported clients to use swarm logic without disrupting current flows(ex: the last agent in a twitter maker team will post as a singular agent akin to current implementation).\r\n- Write dedicated test suite or carefully extend the current tests to confirm proper handling of the majority of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Document feature:\r\n\r\n- How multiple agents can be spawned and coordinated. \r\n- How tasks or sub-tasks are delegated among swarm agents (e.g., parallel vs. sequential).\r\n- How swarm memory storage works.\r\n- Document possible flows.\r\n- How can the utility be extended further. \r\n\r\n",

If a plugin requires an initial setup such as setting up a wallet or a GOAT plugin (e.g adding Polymarket or Uniswap plugins) there is no way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nUpdate the GOAT plugin to get passed a `getSecrets` function for the specific character it is adding actions to. This allows GOAT to check the secrets/env variables and configure its plugins accordingly when being initialized.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements: This change allows developers to install GOAT plugins easily such as Polymarket, Uniswap and Coingecko. It also makes it easier to update the plugin to support multi-chain.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Go to `plugin-goat`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Make sure you have an `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` for Base set\r\n2. Comment out `evmPlugin` in `src/agent.ts`\r\n3. Run the agent and prompt it with: What's the USDC balance of `0x18Bead774f927Af586F86F6d054C269416E163DD`\r\n4. Should give you the balance of `0x18Bead774f927Af586F86F6d054C269416E163DD`\r\n\r\nTo test actions on Base Sepolia simply:\r\n1. Go to `plugin-goat/src/wallet.ts` and change\r\n```typescript\r\nconst chain = base \r\n```\r\nto\r\n```typescript\r\nconst chain = sepolia\r\n```\r\n2. Make sure `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` works for Sepolia\r\n3. Run the agent!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\naguspunk\r\n",

Update `generateText` API to be able to pass through tool options to leverage the model's tool calling capabilities\r\n2. Update the GOAT plugin to use tool calling allowing it to perform complex onchain actions that require multiple steps. Now developers can define high level actions (swap, bet on Polymarket, stake, etc.) and GOAT will take care of handling each action (see the screenshots below)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nI have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo and build it\r\n2. Set up the `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` env variables\r\n3. Uncomment lines 70-72 in the `actions.ts` file in the GOAT plugin\r\n4. Prompt the agent with \"Swap 0.1 USDC for MODE using KIM in a single hop\"\r\n5. In the agent logs you should see all the different steps that the agent is making\r\n6. The tx should fail unless you have ETH and USDC in MODE :)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\nAgent can just do one function call so you need to specify the inputs like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11cec757-fdb1-43b8-affc-562380a38184)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After\r\nAgent can do multiple function calls in an action so inputs are more human friendly:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f80382c-f48f-4096-a2ab-a2cafa72477d)\r\n\r\nIn the background you can also log all the different tool interactions:\r\n<img width=\"630\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 16 24 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/627792d8-eeb7-4110-b2ef-33dd8c83f3da\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\naguspunk\r\n",

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\nfeature: Suppressing initial response messages for specific actions in direct client\r\n\r\nI would like to also extend the twitter client to include this kind of functionality. Right now there is a lot of assumptions about agent behavior such as sending an initial message before an action is processed. Ideally during the upgrade to v2 some of these hard coded behaviors can be addressed. The design should be more conducive to plugin-defined emergent behavior. Maybe there's a discussion to be had at how we can go about this at a lower level rather than going client-by-client to implement this behavior. I'm still relatively new to Eliza community if anyone has groups or public discussions on this.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Changes only affect the direct client's message handling logic.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds support for suppressing initial response messages in the direct client when actions have `suppressInitialMessage` flag set to true. Some actions might not want to send a message until after the action is completed. Now the action will have to manually send a follow up message with the callback.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (changes to existing message handling features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNew property in the `Action` documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Check the modified message handling logic. I've changed `imageGeneration` action to include `suppressInitialMessage` to true for testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create an action with `suppressInitialMessage: true`\r\n2. Send a message to the direct client that triggers this action\r\n3. Verify only the callback message is sent, not the initial response\r\n\r\nKey test cases:\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: true` should only send callback message\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: false` or undefined should send both initial and callback messages\r\n- Action callback functionality should work the same regardless of suppression setting\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check if we should suppress the initial message\r\nconst action = runtime.actions.find(\r\n    (a) => a.name === response.action\r\n);\r\nconst shouldSuppressInitialMessage = action?.suppressInitialMessage;\r\n\r\nif (!shouldSuppressInitialMessage) {\r\n    const _result = await runtime.processActions(\r\n        memory,\r\n        [responseMessage],\r\n        state,\r\n        async (newMessages) => {\r\n            message = newMessages;\r\n            return [memory];\r\n        }\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    if (message) {\r\n        res.json([response, message]);\r\n    } else {\r\n        res.json([response]);\r\n    }\r\n} else {\r\n    // Only process the action without sending initial response\r\n    const _result = await runtime.processActions(\r\n        memory,\r\n        [responseMessage],\r\n        state,\r\n        async (newMessages) => {\r\n            message = newMessages;\r\n            return [memory];\r\n        }\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    if (message) {\r\n        res.json([message]);\r\n    } else {\r\n        res.json([]);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe changes ensure that when an action has `suppressInitialMessage` set to true:\r\n1. The initial response message is not sent in the API response\r\n2. The action's callback message is still sent if present\r\n3. The response array only includes the callback message",

No Way...But how?? The pkgs specifically lists `nodejs_23` and when I run `node version` I will see the `v23.2.0`, but that still does not equal `v20.18.1`.\r\n\r\nSo I did some digging bc Nix can be a pain in the ass at times with weird dependencies errors. So I checked the `pnpm` pkgs source code and found this line https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/394571358ce82dff7411395829aa6a3aad45b907/pkgs/development/tools/pnpm/generic.nix#L28\r\n\r\nAnd `nodejs` pkg points to:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e258b67-924e-4471-a590-d7bde3ac7c64)\r\n\r\nSo this here is the culprit for why a NixOS user will hit this weird error even though we declaratively chose the right node version."

                "body": "@lessuselesss love this PR, but there are some weird problems that will cause a NixOS user to fail when building the codebase with nix flakes enabled.\r\n\r\nFor example, I built this on my NixOS machine and we see this error:\r\n```\r\nWARN\u2009 Unsupported engine: wanted: {\"node\":\"23.3.0\"} (current: {\"node\":\"v20.18.1\",\"pnpm\":\"9.15.0\"})\r\ndocs                                     | \u2009WARN\u2009 Unsupported engine: wanted: {\"node\":\"23.3.0\"} (current: {\"node\":\"v20.18.1\",\"pnpm\":\"9.15.0\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may think...what?! No Way...But how?? The pkgs specifically lists `nodejs_23` and when I run `node version` I will see the `v23.2.0`, but that still does not equal `v20.18.1`.\r\n\r\nSo I did some digging bc Nix can be a pain in the ass at times with weird dependencies errors. So I checked the `pnpm` pkgs source code and found this line https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/394571358ce82dff7411395829aa6a3aad45b907/pkgs/development/tools/pnpm/generic.nix#L28\r\n\r\nAnd `nodejs` pkg points to:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e258b67-924e-4471-a590-d7bde3ac7c64)\r\n\r\nSo this here is the culprit for why a NixOS user will hit this weird error even though we declaratively chose the right node version."

While there are translations for several other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, etc.), Hebrew-speaking users cannot read the documentation in their native language. This is particularly important because Hebrew requires special RTL (Right-to-Left) formatting considerations.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Hebrew (RTL) translation of the main README.md as README_HE.md, including:  \r\n\r\n - Full translation of all sections including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines  \r\n - Proper RTL formatting using HTML/CSS directives\r\n - Addition of Hebrew (\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\nMaintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) - inadequate because it doesn't handle RTL formatting properly and translations are often inaccurate\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nHebrew is spoken by approximately 9 million people globally\r\n\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format)\r\n\r\nSpecial attention should be paid to RTL formatting using <div align=\"rtl\"> tags to ensure proper text direction\r\n\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Hebrew-speaking developer community",

Use proper sequential numbering (1, 2)\r\n2. Replace \"eg.\" with \"Example:\" to match documentation style\r\n3. Use a more clear example number (9999)\r\n\r\nThe final format should look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.\r\n    \r\n    1. The name of the branch should start with the issue number and be descriptive of the changes you are making.  \r\n    2. Example: 9999--add-test-for-bug-123]\r\n ```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Keeping \"eg.\" but it's less formal than our documentation style\r\n2. Using different formatting like \"For example:\" or \"(example:)\" but \"Example:\" is cleaner\r\n4. Using a bullet point for the example, but numbered lists better show the relationship between the instruction and its example\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis change aligns with our documentation styleguide and makes the contribution guidelines more consistent and professional.

Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache\n2. npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces\n3. installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation)\n\nThis can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B\n\nUsers generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it).\n\nHere, that expectation is broken\n\n### Details\n\nSee PoC.\n\nIn it, overrides from a single run of A get leaked into e.g. `~/Library/Caches/pnpm/metadata/registry.npmjs.org/rimraf.json` and persistently affect all other projects using the cache\n\n### PoC\n\nPostinstall code used in PoC is benign and can be inspected in <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ponyhooves?activeTab=code>, it's just a `console.log`\n\n1. Remove store and cache\n   On mac: `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/pnpm ~/Library/pnpm/store`\n   This step is not required in general, but we'll be using a popular package for PoC that's likely cached\n2. Create `A/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"A\",\n     \"pnpm\": { \"overrides\": { \"rimraf>glob\": \"npm:ponyhooves@1\" } },\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i --ignore-scripts` (the flag is not required, but the point of the demo is to show that it doesn't help)\n4. Create `B/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"B\",\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i`\n\nResult:\n```console\nPackages: +3\n+++\nProgress: resolved 3, reused 3, downloaded 0, added 3, done\nnode_modules/.pnpm/ponyhooves@1.0.1/node_modules/ponyhooves: Running postinstall script, done in 51ms\n\ndependencies:\n+ rimraf 6.0.1\n\nDone in 1.4s\n```\n\nAlso, that code got leaked into another project and it's lockfile now! \n\n### Impact\n\nGlobal state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs\n\nAs a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pnpm/pnpm

This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. \n\n### Details\nI have exploited this vulnerability in a Windows service using version 5.22.11 of the module, to escalate privileges (in an environment where I am authorized to do so). However, as far as I can see from the code, it is still present in master branch at time of writing, on line [403/404 of network.js](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/blob/3a92931c7d46605ffddc1aacb97a9727273b2888/lib/network.js#L403).\n\nThe SSID is obtained from `netsh wlan show interface ...` in `getWindowsWirelessIfaceSSID`, and then passed to `cmd.exe /d /s /c \"netsh wlan show profiles ...` in `getWindowsIEEE8021x`, without sanitization.\n\n### PoC\nFirst, the command injection payload should be included in the connected Wi-Fi SSID. For example create hotspot on mobile phone or other laptop, set SSID to payload, connect to it with victim Windows system. Two example SSID's to demonstrate exploitation are below.\n\nDemonstration to run ping command indefinitely:\n```\na\" | ping /t 127.0.0.1 &\n```\n\nRun executable with privileges of the user in which vulnerable function is executed. Chosen executable should should be placed in (assuming system drive is C): `C:\\a\\a.exe`.\n```\na\" | %SystemDrive%\\a\\a.exe &\n```\n\nThen, the vulnerable function can be executed on the victim system, for example, using:\n```\nconst si = require('systeminformation');\nsi.networkInterfaces((net) => { console.log(net) });\n```\n\nNow the chosen command, `PING.exe` or `a.exe` will be run through the cmd.exe command line.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>sebhildebrandt/systeminformation (systeminformation)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.23.8`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n### [`v5.23.6`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone UTC, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This improves code clarity as there were many places where a MemoryManager is created and took tableName and the code said this would act on a different database table, but in fact all of those lead to the memories table in the database, and tableName was just being mapped to type there, so memoryType is more appropriate name\r\n\r\n<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copy and pasting relevant items out of the html comments. -->\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\nNo issue\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section is to be filled out before final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis improves code clarity and understandability.  Previously the code strongly implied that the MemoryManager would act on different tables in the underlying DB, whereas all instantiations of the MemoryManager actually write to the same table in the DB but write a string to the 'type' field to distinguish (and namespace) different types of memories.  This PR renames 'tableName' as 'memoryType' \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nCode improvement\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?

I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.  I know there is alot of interest in the memory system as well so as part of the core it should be as clear as possible IMHO."

            "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, we observed issues with aixbt, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Reclaim as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Reclaim is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nUpdates \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating **Reclaim** as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zero-knowledge proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-reclaim README.\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Proof Verification Example\r\nBelow is a screenshot showcasing the generated proof and its verification process:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 39 17\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c64b01-47b1-4ece-8624-9b65e7624f66\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 31 20\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41d675e-9249-4c46-9f12-396f02b7d8b2\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure the following environment variables (generated from the [Reclaim Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)):\r\n```\r\n# Reclaim Protocol\r\nRECLAIM_APP_ID= # Reclaim App ID\r\nRECLAIM_APP_SECRET= # Reclaim App Secret\r\n\r\n# Verifiable Inference Configuration\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_ENABLED=true # Set to true to enable verifiable inference\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=reclaim # Options: reclaim, opacity (soon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run a character using the command:\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"`\r\n\r\n3. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n4. Interact with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- Automated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n- No database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n--> Gajesh#0000\r\n",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nCurrently the Solana and EVM Plugin are not aware of the TEE Plugin and a lot of custom code and configuration must be done to add deployment of Eliza agents in a TEE. This PR solves this issue by making the TEE Plugin an opt-in feature that allows developers to build a TEE compatible Eliza Agent to deploy in a Intel TDX Server running the Dstack SDK.\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds a new env variable called `TEE_MODE` with values of `OFF`, `LOCAL`, `DOCKER`, `PRODUCTION`. When the  `TEE_MODE` is set to an option other than `OFF` or `undefined` then the agent will utilize the TEE Plugin to handle wallet generations for the Solana Plugin.\r\n\r\nEvery time a key is derived to generate a wallet in the Solana Plugin the following happens:\r\n- Derives an ed25519 key based on the value of the `WALLET_SECRET_SALT`\r\n- Generates a Remote Attestation Quote with the `reportdata` that includes a JSON string of `{agentId: ${agentId}, publicKey: ${publicKey}}`\r\n- In the logs, a user can take the RA Quote and the `reportdata` to verify publicly at https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ \r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeature\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

There will be another step in this PR to add documentation within the advanced section to step developers through setting up their Eliza Agent to be TEE compatible. This documentation will take developers through the process of\r\n- Building an Agent locally with TEE_MODE enabled\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a locally deployed Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a docker container of the Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the Eliza Agent within a Real TEE via Phala Network's Dstack Dashboard\r\n- How to verify a Remote Attestation on https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ and validate the `reportdata` passed into the RA Quote\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

Please describe.**\r\nFor our use case at Phala Network, we are building a base template docker image for developers to deploy their agents to our TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) Cloud. However, we want to make the loading of the character json file easier to add via a command line argument vs building a new docker image with the new character file. Our main pain point is we want the user journey for technical to non-technical users to be able to publish their character configuration file to a storage protocol like arweave, ipfs, aws, etc. and be able to load those character files in through a command argument. This will make our deploy service easier with a docker compose file that can list the file id location in an argument like `pnpm start --characterUrl=https://characterfile.url`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe developer journey would go as follows:\r\n- Generate a character JSON file through any means (keep this step unopinionated)\r\n- Publish the character file to a storage service. (Ex. Use Thirdweb to post and pin to IPFS https://972b74063c2cd00df1a4cf777bf37d0a.ipfscdn.io/ipfs/bafybeicod5xghpshbxmfb3sh2ccfbb5657dgvxthgwolb42srz4a5iadwm/)\r\n- Create a new CLI argument to the `pnpm start` command named `--characterUrl` that will take in the URL where the character file is hosted\r\n- When the agent is being initialized, `fetch` the character file from the URL and allow for the agent to go through the natural process of starting up the agent\r\n\r\nCode changes should be minimal and would not affect any core functionality so the risk is low.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatives were building a web app similar to vvaifu, but this would not be a good user experience for cloud deployments or a good strategy to compete with them since we are focused on different problems.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis will help bring more users to Eliza with better security and privacy guarantees by utilizing TEE for safe Eliza agent cloud deployments.\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nExample deployment with a mock docker compose file in the TEE Cloud.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0bec2d0-aa0e-418c-bf88-67e37edf1a17)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Added multichain support, the current version of the plugin only supported mainnet and Base, and there have been several requests for additional EVM chain support.\r\n\r\n- The plugin lacked test coverage, so we initiated tests alongside the feature development, starting with WalletProvider.\r\n- Refactored the plugin to make it more test-friendly and modular.\r\n- Added multichain support (for viem chains)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Improvements: Refactoring, cleaning, and testing of the existing plugin.\r\n- Features: Non-breaking changes to add EVM multichain support. The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility. Transfers are not yet fully functional, as noted in [Issue #735](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/735). This will be addressed in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup. No changes are required at this time.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## How was it tested\r\n\r\n- Ran test scripts \r\n- Verified functionality through agent interactions:\r\n<img width=\"627\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 2 42 13\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a99dea38-560f-46e4-8826-4e98be175486\">\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nFile: packages/plugin-evm/src/tests/wallet.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNo manual testing is required; automated tests have been implemented and cover the new functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou",

This PR focuses on enabling multichain support and making the plugin more test-friendly via TDD + a foundation to extend the plugin with more features.\n\nThe GOAT plugin does look interesting, and I\u2019ll take a closer look to see if it aligns with the goals here.\n\nLet me know if you think it\u2019s better to pivot entirely to GOAT, or if continuing with this plugin (and fixing the mentioned issues) is a good path forward!"

Added multichain support, the current version of the plugin only supported mainnet and Base, and there have been several requests for additional EVM chain support.\r\n\r\n- The plugin lacked test coverage, so we initiated tests alongside the feature development, starting with WalletProvider.\r\n- Refactored the plugin to make it more test-friendly and modular.\r\n- Added multichain support (for viem chains)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Improvements: Refactoring, cleaning, and testing of the existing plugin.\r\n- Fixes: fix transfer action\r\n- Features: Non-breaking changes to add EVM multichain support. The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup. No changes are required at this time.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## How was it tested\r\n\r\n- Ran test scripts \r\n- Verified functionality through agent interactions:\r\n<img width=\"709\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 5 58 35\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afde079e-7eaa-47cd-89df-60a93f895cd3\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nFile: packages/plugin-evm/src/tests/wallet.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nTry to add your own chain in the character and ask the agent to send some tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou",

Manually test the memory-fetching feature by:\r\n   - Querying with and without the `limit` parameter.\r\n   - Verifying that the sorting order (`createdAt DESC`) is maintained.\r\n3.

            "body": "# Add Slack Integration for Eliza AI Agent\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis PR adds a new Slack client integration for the Eliza AI agent, enabling seamless communication between Slack workspaces and the Eliza AI system. The integration includes robust message handling, conversation management, and standalone example scripts for easy testing and deployment.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Full Slack bot integration with event handling and message management\r\n- Message deduplication system to prevent duplicate responses\r\n- Thread-aware conversation handling\r\n- Support for attachments and media files\r\n- Conversation summarization capabilities\r\n- Standalone example scripts for testing and development\r\n\r\n## Example Scripts\r\nThe package includes several standalone scripts in `packages/client-slack/src/examples/`:\r\n\r\n1. **standalone-example.ts**\r\n   - Basic bot setup and connection\r\n   - Demonstrates message sending, threading, and image attachments\r\n   - Includes error handling and port management\r\n\r\n2. **standalone-summarize.ts**\r\n   - Shows conversation summarization capabilities\r\n   - Demonstrates handling attachments and threaded discussions\r\n\r\n3. **standalone-attachment.ts**\r\n   - Comprehensive attachment handling\r\n   - File upload and sharing capabilities\r\n\r\n## Setup and Configuration\r\n### 1. Slack App Creation\r\n![Slack App Creation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIFlowML/eliza_aiflow/add-slack-plugin/packages/client-slack/src/examples/sc_01.png)\r\n- Create a new Slack app using the provided manifest\r\n- Configure bot permissions and event subscriptions\r\n\r\n### 2. Bot Configuration\r\n![Bot Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIFlowML/eliza_aiflow/add-slack-plugin/packages/client-slack/src/examples/sc_02.png)\r\n- Set up OAuth scopes and bot token\r\n- Configure event subscriptions and interactive components\r\n\r\n## Testing Instructions\r\n### Running Example Scripts\r\n1. Set up environment variables in `.env`:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   SLACK_APP_ID=your_app_id\r\n   SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\r\n   SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\r\n   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_signing_secret\r\n   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token\r\n   SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=your_verification_token\r\n   SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=test_channel_id\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run the basic example:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-example.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Test summarization:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-summarize.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Try attachment handling:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-attachment.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Verifying Integration\r\n1. Start a new conversation with the bot\r\n2. Test direct mentions and thread replies\r\n3. Try uploading files and requesting summaries\r\n4. Verify message handling in different channel types (DM, public, private)\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n- TypeScript-based implementation with full type safety\r\n- Event-driven architecture for message handling\r\n- Built-in error handling and logging\r\n- Configurable message deduplication\r\n- Extensible provider system for easy customization\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n- Full setup guide in README.md\r\n- Example scripts with inline documentation\r\n- Type definitions for all public APIs\r\n- Environment configuration guide\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] TypeScript implementation with full type coverage\r\n- [x] Comprehensive example scripts\r\n- [x] Setup screenshots and documentation\r\n- [x] Error handling and logging\r\n- [x] Message deduplication system\r\n- [x] Thread awareness\r\n- [x] Attachment handling\r\n- [x] Environment validation\r\n- [x] Testing instructions",

A\r\nmain .gitignore file has already been created at the root level, which\r\ncontains all the necessary exclusions, including those for .ts files. This\r\neliminates the need for a separate .gitignore file in the agent/ folder.\r\n\r\n2- I have corrected the hardcoded path issue by replacing it with a\r\nrelative path using __dirname for better portability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n3-I understand the concern about deleting sample characters. To test our\r\nsports analysis functionality, I temporarily replaced the sample character\r\nfile but have since reverted it back. Rest assured, I have all the original\r\nsample files, including the personality you provided and the ones we tested.\r\n\r\nOn Tue, 10 Dec 2024 at 12:00, Odilitime ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n\r\n> ***@***.**** requested changes on this pull request.\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n>\r\n> On agent/.gitignore\r\n> <https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/971#discussion_r1878363005>:\r\n>\r\n> Revert or explain why this is necessary\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n>\r\n> In agent/src/services/twitter/services.ts\r\n> <https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/971#discussion_r1878369796>:\r\n>\r\n> > +// Load environment variables from .env file\r\n> +dotenv.config();\r\n> +\r\n> +// Define constants\r\n> +const BEARER_TOKEN = process.env.BEARER_TOKEN;\r\n> +const BASE_URL = \"https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent\";\r\n> +\r\n> +/**\r\n> + * Fetch recent tweets related to sports.\r\n> + * @param maxResults Number of tweets to fetch (default: 10)\r\n> + */\r\n> +\r\n> +// this function will get data from documnets for buliding custom knowledge base\r\n> +export const fetchDocuments = async (): Promise<string[]> => {\r\n> +    const pdfService = new PdfService();\r\n> +    const pdfFilePath = \"C:/Users/Dell/eliza-1/agent/src/services/twitter/game.pdf\";  //a dummy pdf\r\n>\r\n> no hard coded paths, node has __dirname if you want to give a relative\r\n> path to this file\r\n> https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#__dirname\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n>\r\n> On characters/trump.character.json\r\n> <https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/971#discussion_r1878371462>:\r\n>\r\n> I'm not sure we should be deleting our sample characters without replacing\r\n> them\r\n>\r\n> \u2014\r\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/971#pullrequestreview-2492783366>,\r\n> or unsubscribe\r\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/A25IBTDKIAJAXDO3DUXL2E32E4FYHAVCNFSM6AAAAABTLDQIYOVHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43YUDVNRWFEZLROVSXG5CSMV3GSZLXHMZDIOJSG44DGMZWGY>\r\n> .\r\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.Message ID:\r\n> ***@***.***>\r\n>\r\n"

Review the plugin's architecture in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/index.ts`\r\n2. Check the market making strategy implementation in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/strategies/simple-market-making.ts`\r\n3. Review type definitions and configuration interface in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/types.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`\r\n2. Configure Hummingbot instance details in your character config:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"plugins\": [\"@eliza/plugin-hummingbot\"],\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"HUMMINGBOT_CONFIG\": {\r\n      \"instance\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"http://localhost:15888\",\r\n        \"apiKey\": \"your-api-key\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}",

Lastly, don\u2019t forget to include your .env configurations in the .env.example file for consistency."

            "body": "\r\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nTypeScript type error in Slack client when handling message attachments. The error occurs because the `attachments` property in the `Content` interface expects an array of `Media` type objects, but the code was only providing a subset of the required properties.\r\n\r\n**Error message:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nType '{ text: string; }[]' is not assignable to type 'Media[]'.\r\nType '{ text: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Media': id, url, title, source, description\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use the Slack client implementation.\r\n2. Try to create a message content with attachments.\r\n3. The code attempts to create an attachment with only the `text` property:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent ? [{ text: attachmentContent }] : undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe code should properly implement the `Media` type interface by providing all required properties:\r\n\r\n- `id` (string)\r\n- `url` (string)\r\n- `title` (string)\r\n- `source` (string)\r\n- `description` (string)\r\n- `text` (string)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nUpdate the attachment creation to include all required `Media` type properties:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent\r\n    ? [{\r\n        id: stringToUuid(`${event.ts}-attachment`),\r\n        url: '',  // Since this is text content, no URL is needed\r\n        title: 'Text Attachment',\r\n        source: 'slack',\r\n        description: 'Text content from Slack message',\r\n        text: attachmentContent\r\n    }]\r\n    : undefined,\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nThis issue affects the Slack client's message handling functionality in the `packages/client-slack/src/messages.ts` file. The fix ensures type safety while maintaining the intended functionality of handling text attachments from Slack messages.",

This shift will scale message traffic astronomically, analogous to the web\u2019s rise in the 2000s. Just as Cloudflare and https secured web traffic, messaging will need robust scalable end-to-end encrypted messages to protect sensitive information.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nRisks of not using end-to-end encryption for agent interactions exposes the users to what is called as Man in the **Middle Attacks**.\r\n\r\n> **Man in the Middle Attacks**: Intercept requests in between to alter or manipulate data sent or received by the AI service\r\n\r\n- **Phishing**: Messages can be intercepted and manipulated.\r\n- **Privacy**: Sensitive information read by unwanted parties\r\n- **Tampering**: Content can be altered without detection.\r\n\r\n:::tip\r\nMore concrete sensitive data could include credit card details, private keys and passwords which is not yet widely spread but as agents become smarter more use cases will include this type of sharing.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n## XMTP\r\n\r\nEliza agents come with a ready to use client that uses XMTP providing end-to-end encrypted messaging for every agent intereaction, crucial for privacy, security, and compliance provided by the XMTP network.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n\r\n- **E2EE**: End to end encrypted MLS encryption\r\n- **Multi-agent**: Support multi-agent through group chats\r\n- **Interoperable**: Works across all platforms and frontends\r\n- **Scalable**: Decentralized, open-source\r\n- **Anonymous**: By default every identity is ephemeral and anonymous.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nInstall the `xmtp` package\r\n\r\n```bash [cmd]\r\nbun install xmtp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis is how you can use the `xmtp` package to create an agent and handle messages.\r\n\r\n- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: This will encrypt all messages and make it available through its public address or ens domain.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { XMTP } from \"xmtp\";\r\n\r\nconst xmtp = new XMTP(onMessage, {\r\n    encryptionKey: WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY,\r\n});\r\nawait xmtp.init();\r\nconst onMessage = async (message, user) => {\r\n    console.log(`Decoded message: ${message.content.text} by ${user.address}`);\r\n    // Your AI model response\r\n    await xmtp.send({\r\n        message: response,\r\n        originalMessage: message,\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information visit XMTP [website](https://xmtp.org/)",

            "body": "_sup fam, today i put in a few hours to extend the Eliza framework by adding some core trading functionality for on-chain solana bots. my focus was to create a set of tools that will allow agents to execute trades, manage risk, and pull critical data. here's what I added and worked on:_\r\n\r\n**What I Added/Completed Today:**\r\n\r\n1. nice_funcs.py:\r\n\r\n- Added a library of helpful functions tailored for Solana on-chain trading.\r\n- Functions now include position management, wallet holdings fetching, and other utilities to make trading more efficient.\r\n- This has been tested with my personal bots but should integrate well with Eliza\u2019s architecture.\r\n\r\n2. bot.py:\r\n\r\n- Built a script that allows agents to perform trading actions such as:\r\n- Closing a position (action 0).\r\n- Opening a position (action 1).\r\n- Adding stop-loss logic (action 2).\r\n- Implementing breakout trades (action 3).\r\n- Market-making logic (action 5).\r\n- Currently, it uses basic user input to decide the action, but this will soon be fully bot-driven.\r\n\r\n3. get_ohlcv_data.py\r\n\r\n- this allows the agent to get open, high, low, close and volume data\r\n- also have moving averages and examples of other technical indicators\r\n\r\n4. dontshare.py (ignored):\r\n\r\n- Added placeholders for sensitive information such as:\r\n- Solana private keys.\r\n- BirdEye API keys.\r\n- RPC URLs.\r\n- Added this file to .gitignore to ensure it doesn\u2019t get accidentally pushed.\r\n\r\n5. Updated README.md:\r\n\r\n- Wrote a comprehensive README to document how to use these new tools and scripts.\r\n- It includes detailed steps for configuration, usage, and what each action/script does.\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Why This Matters:**\r\n\r\n- These tools lay the groundwork for enabling AI agents to perform advanced trading strategies directly on-chain.\r\n- The added functionality simplifies interaction with Solana contracts while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.\r\n- It ensures agents can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention\u2014just plug in the strategy, and they're good to go.\r\n\r\n**What's Next?**\r\n\r\n- I'm researching the best way to transition from Python to TypeScript or add a shell for TS compatibility, depending on the project direction.\r\n- Planning to integrate more trading actions like:\r\n- Funding buys (action 6).\r\n- Liquidation monitoring (action 7).\r\n- Always happy to hear feedback on how this integrates with Eliza\u2019s current architecture and if there are specific improvements to focus on.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity to contribute. Let me know if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to adjust or refine for tomorrow.",

            "body": "# feat: Twitter Spaces Integration\r\n\r\n**Discord**: `slkz.`\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces integration of **Twitter Spaces** into the AI agent, providing:\r\n- **Automatic** Space launch decisions (random chance, business hours, cooldown intervals, etc.).\r\n- **Multi-speaker** handling (configurable `maxSpeakers`).\r\n- **Speaker queue** management for overflow.\r\n- **GPT-based filler** messages (welcome, idle, closing, etc.).\r\n- Optional **plugins**: Idle monitor, TTS bridging (STT/TTS), and local audio recording.\r\n\r\nNo breaking changes are introduced beyond **adding** this new functionality and **updating** the `agent-twitter-client` to support advanced speaker logic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Flow Recap\r\n\r\n1. **Periodic Check**  \r\n   We call `startPeriodicSpaceCheck()`, typically with a dynamic interval.  \r\n   - **When no Space is running**: we do `shouldLaunchSpace()`, which decides whether to launch based on random chance, business hours, and a minimum cooldown.  \r\n   - **When a Space is running**: we call `manageCurrentSpace()` more frequently (e.g. every 20 seconds) to handle speaker timeouts, queue acceptance, occupancy changes, and potential stop conditions.\r\n\r\n2. **Space Creation**  \r\n   - We generate a `SpaceConfig` from either pre-set `charSpaces.topics` or GPT (if none are provided).  \r\n   - We instantiate a new `Space`, conditionally add:\r\n     - **RecordToDiskPlugin** (audio recording to disk).\r\n     - **SttTtsPlugin** (speech-to-text and text-to-speech bridging).\r\n     - **IdleMonitorPlugin** (idle detection).  \r\n   - We hook into events: `speakerRequest`, `occupancyUpdate`, `idleTimeout`, etc.\r\n\r\n3. **Speaker Logic**  \r\n   - We maintain an **array** of `activeSpeakers` and a **queue** for overflow if `activeSpeakers.length` hits `maxSpeakers`.  \r\n   - Each speaker is subject to `speakerMaxDurationMs`; upon exceeding it, we remove them (optionally speaking a filler message).  \r\n   - If a speaker is removed and the queue is **non-empty**, we accept the next queued request.  \r\n   - If more than `maxSpeakers` are active for any reason, we remove extras.\r\n\r\n4. **Stopping**  \r\n   - `stopSpace()` finalizes the Space, logs the time of completion (`lastSpaceEndedAt`), clears states, and sets `isSpaceRunning = false`.  \r\n   - The system then reverts to checking at a slower interval until we decide to launch a new Space again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### A) `.env` / Environment Variables\r\n\r\nIf you want to store GPT or ElevenLabs tokens:\r\n```bash\r\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\r\nELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...\r\n```\r\n### B) `character.json` \u2192 `\"twitterSpaces\"` Field\r\n\r\nBelow is an **example** JSON snippet for the `twitterSpaces` object in `character.json`:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n  \"twitterSpaces\": {\r\n    // Maximum simultaneous speakers (1 = single speaker, 2+ = multi)\r\n    \"maxSpeakers\": 2,\r\n\r\n    // Array of predefined topic strings\r\n    // If empty, we use GPT to generate some\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"Blockchain Trends\",\r\n      \"AI Innovations\"\r\n    ],\r\n\r\n    // Max overall duration (in minutes) for the Space\r\n    \"typicalDurationMinutes\": 45,\r\n\r\n    // Idle threshold in ms (e.g., 300000 = 5 minutes)\r\n    \"idleKickTimeoutMs\": 300000,\r\n\r\n    // Minimum interval (minutes) before launching another Space\r\n    \"minIntervalBetweenSpacesMinutes\": 60,\r\n\r\n    // If true, only launch between 9:00-17:00 UTC\r\n    \"businessHoursOnly\": true,\r\n\r\n    // Probability (0.0 - 1.0) at each check\r\n    \"randomChance\": 0.3,\r\n\r\n    // Flags to enable or disable specific plugins\r\n    \"enableIdleMonitor\": true,\r\n    \"enableSttTts\": true,\r\n    \"enableRecording\": false,\r\n\r\n    // TTS / GPT config (e.g., for ElevenLabs)\r\n    \"voiceId\": \"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\",\r\n    \"sttLanguage\": \"en\",\r\n    \"gptModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\r\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful AI co-host assistant.\",\r\n\r\n    // Max speaking time (ms) for each speaker\r\n    \"speakerMaxDurationMs\": 240000\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key Fields**:\r\n- **`maxSpeakers`**: 1 for single-speaker style, or higher to allow multiple.  \r\n- **`topics`**: if empty, GPT auto-generates.  \r\n- **`idleKickTimeoutMs`**: triggers `idleTimeout` if no audio detected for that duration.  \r\n- **`randomChance`**: probability for each check to spawn a Space.  \r\n- **`speakerMaxDurationMs`**: automatically remove a speaker after this many ms.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Potential Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Audio Message Queue**: Manage TTS outputs in a queue to avoid overlapping messages.  \r\n- **Knowledge Storage**: Gather insights from Space interactions and store them as knowledge or memory afterwards.  \r\n- **Speaker-less Spaces**: Optionally launch Spaces without external speakers, functioning as \u201cTED talk\u201d monologues or scheduled broadcasts.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- This is our **first** official integration of Twitter Spaces, not an upgrade from a previous version.  \r\n- **No Breaking Changes** expected outside the new `agent-twitter-client` version.  \r\n- For questions, you can reach me on Discord: `slkz.`\r\n\r\nThank you!",

            "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

The plugin supports complex queries and integrates with the existing API.\r\n\r\n<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copy and pasting relevant items out of the html comments. -->\r\nRelates to:\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\nCloses #1431\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section is to be filled out before final review and merge. -->\r\nRisks\r\n<!-- Low, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be effected. -->\r\nLow: 1.The plugin has been extensively tested on Apify with millions of executions, ensuring stability and reliability.\r\n2.After adding the current plugin, there is no place to call it yet. The parts involving other modules will be submitted later. For now, please review this plugin first.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nWhat does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin for fetching Twitter data reliably and efficiently. It addresses the limitations of using personal Twitter accounts for scraping, such as rate limits and account bans, by leveraging a proven solution that has already processed millions of requests on Apify.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change is this?\r\n<!-- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) Improvements (misc. changes to existing features) Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality) Updates (new versions of included code) -->\r\nFeatures: Adds a new plugin for Twitter data fetching.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. --><!-- ## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work? -->\r\nAI agents require large amounts of high-quality, timely data to function effectively. The intelligence of an AI agent depends on two key factors:\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the underlying AI model.\r\n\r\nThe quality, quantity, and timeliness of the data it processes.\r\n\r\nUsing personal Twitter accounts for scraping data poses significant risks, including account bans and rate limits. This plugin provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution for fetching Twitter data, which has already been validated through millions of executions on Apify.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am offering free usage credits to help developers get started quickly and contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed?\r\nI added a new environment variable and have updated the documentation in all relevant languages. I also explained the purpose of this variable.\r\nTWITTER_API_IO_KEY=\r\n#A third-party Twitter API key for data retrieval. This shared key is for testing only - get your personal key at https://twitterapi.io to avoid QPS limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\nIn the `src/tests` directory under my newly added component folder, you can find all the unit tests for the APIs. I ran the command `pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test` and confirmed that all unit tests passed successfully.\r\n\r\nDetailed testing steps\r\n`pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test`\r\n\r\nVerify that the plugin can fetch Twitter data without login.\r\n\r\nTest the plugin's performance under high concurrency.\r\n\r\nEnsure the plugin handles rate limits and errors gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscord username: [kaitoeasyapi]\r\nTwitter: [kaitoEasyApi](https://x.com/kaitoEasyApi)\r\nApify Twitter Actor: https://apify.com/kaitoeasyapi/twitter-x-data-tweet-scraper-pay-per-result-cheapest\r\n\r\n",

It is necessary to ensure that they are not leaked through workflows being run on behalf of malicious pull requests. In addition to restrictions on running CI/CD workflows we recommend setting up a quota on those keys, and rotating them periodically.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n1. This PR adds two basic tests:\r\n- smoke tests: checks that the project can be built and run\r\n- \"Hello Trump\": checks that the project can use one of the built-in characters (Trump) to successfully query a LLM (OpenAI).\r\n\r\nThe \"Hello Trump\" test requires OpenAI API keys to run. If the API keys are not available, this test will be skipped.\r\n\r\n2. This PR also adds initial (proof of concept) version of integration testing framework. We plan to continue development of this framework in the future as will be adding more integration tests.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThe goal of these tests is to establish a quality gate that every PR should pass at a minimum. We recommend that the tests are run at least:\r\n- on every PR before merging it\r\n- every time the main/stable branch is updated\r\n\r\nAs a policy, merges to main/stable branch should not be allowed if they would break the tests.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nThe included file `tests/README.md` describes the procedure how to set the tests up in a CI/CD environment. The API keys should be set up the repository settings under \"secrets\". When present, they will automatically be added to the .env file for the duration of the workflow.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nThis PR adds a workflow file `integrationTests.yaml` with two jobs. The reviewer should:\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3. Check output of jobs for any errors.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3.

These changes:\r\n- fix some existing issues with smoke and integration tests failing (esp. giving agent a fixed time to start that was not always sufficient)\r\n- extend integration test library with a full wrapper for setting up / tearing down a test\r\n- refactor existing integration test (\"Hello Trump\") to use new library\r\n- fix a potential issue with possible leak of API keys (not related to integration tests themselves)\r\n- remove a dependency that was previously added but is no longer required\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovement + bug fix + feature\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis is to improve overall project quality via better testing..\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNone\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nTo test the tests, these changes need to be run in CI workflow.\r\nIf either smoke or integration tests fail, the PR should NOT be merged. In that case we will check the logs and update the PR as necessary.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nuser98634",

This could be valuable documentation for other developers.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe Discord client was failing with the following error:\r\n```\r\nError [TokenInvalid]: An invalid token was provided.\r\n    at WebSocketManager.connect (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/websocket/WebSocketManager.js:136:26)\r\n    at Client.login (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/Client.js:228:21)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was happening even though the tokens were correctly set in the `.env` file. The issue was in how the tokens were being resolved from environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI fixed this by:\r\n\r\n1. Ensuring proper token resolution in `eliza/packages/client-discord/src/index.ts`:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Get the token using runtime's getSecret\r\nconst token = this.character?.settings?.secrets?.DISCORD_API_TOKEN;\r\n\r\n// If it's a variable reference (${...}), resolve it from environment\r\nif (token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}')) {\r\n    const envVarName = token.slice(2, -1);\r\n    this.apiToken = process.env[envVarName] || '';\r\n} else {\r\n    this.apiToken = token || '';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Adding debug logging to track token resolution:\r\n```typescript\r\nelizaLogger.debug('Token resolution debug:', {\r\n    characterName: this.character.name,\r\n    rawToken: token,\r\n    isEnvVar: token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}'),\r\n    envVarName: token?.startsWith('${') ? token.slice(2, -1) : null,\r\n    envValue: token?.startsWith('${') ? process.env[token.slice(2, -1)] : null\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Points\r\n1. Character files should reference environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"secrets\": {\r\n            \"DISCORD_API_TOKEN\": \"${DISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE}\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `.env` file should contain the actual tokens:\r\n```env\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE=actual_token_here\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JUAN=actual_token_here\r\n```\r\n(where Julie and Juan are agents names)\r\n\r\n3. The token resolution process:\r\n   - First checks character's settings.secrets\r\n   - If the value is a variable reference (${...}), resolves it from environment\r\n   - Otherwise uses the raw value\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTo verify the fix:\r\n1. Ensure tokens are correctly set in `.env`\r\n2. Run the bot with both characters:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --characters=\"characters/julie.character.json,characters/juan.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n3. Check debug logs for token resolution process \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI suggest:\r\n1. Adding this documentation to the main repository\r\n2. Possibly including it in the official docs under a \"Troubleshooting\" or \"Configuration\" section\r\n3. Adding debug logs to help other developers diagnose similar issues\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like me to create a PR with these changes. ",

Adding `customSystemPrompt` parameter to generateText function for image gen system prompt\r\n2. Implementing structured prompt engineering for image generation\r\n3. Creating detailed prompt generation guidelines with specific steps\r\n4. Setting up a standardized prompt structure for consistency\r\n5. Adding style-specific prompt customization\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?\r\nTo improve image generation quality by providing structured, detailed prompts that consider key aspects like:\r\n- Main subject focus\r\n- Environment and setting\r\n- Lighting and atmosphere\r\n- Color relationships\r\n- Composition guidelines\r\n- Style integration\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to document:\r\n- New `customSystemPrompt` parameter in generateText\r\n- Image prompt structure and guidelines\r\n- Style customization options\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the generateText changes in `packages/core/src/generation.ts`\r\n2. Check the image prompt system in image generation implementation\r\n3. Examine the structured prompt generation workflow\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nI tested locally by running `pnpm start` with a new character that had ModelProviderName.HEURIST as the modelProvider and \"direct\" in the clients. Everything seemed to work well.\r\n\r\n## Deploy Notes\r\nNo special deployment steps required. Feature is automatically active when using the plugin-image-generation functionality.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\ntao8617\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "# Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to extend Eliza's capabilities with FerePro Agent. FerePro is an agent developed by [FereAI](https://www.fereai.xyz) which can perform open world Q&A related to various crypto topics like - Token Research, Investment Decisions, KOL research, category research, actions (swap, trade and more). It can interpret and answer questions of various complexities. We believe that adding this as a plugin will significantly improve Eliza's capabilities to perform research and Q&A.\r\n\r\n# Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA Plugin for FerePro in Eliza's codebase.\r\n\r\n# Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs an alternate, we will need to add a lot of tools and multi agentic capabilities to Eliza. FerePro can abstract all of that. \r\nDisclaimer: I'm a co founder and core dev at FereAI.\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n1. FerePro APIs can provide streaming answer as well as non streaming answer. This plugin must support both the use cases.\r\n2. FerePro APIs also provide a bunch of intermediate responses. This is usually shown in UI for users to get a view of happenings behind the scenes. They should only be enabled when this plugin is run in debug mode. Developers can use this info to troubleshoot or get support from Fere team.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n1. Developers will need to [get API keys from FereAI](https://docs.fereai.xyz/docs/api/api_access). \r\n3. This key must be passed to the plugin for it to work.\r\n4. FerePro is a freemium API. There is a limit on questions that can be asked for free. (We can revise the limits based on community feedback). For extended use cases, the developers must top up their account by visiting fereai.xyz.\r\n\r\n",

This should be removed so that character card bios can be updated upon restart.  There's not much of a performance gain from caching anyway, as the bio is only loaded once on startup.\r\n\r\ntwitter login Cookies are also cached indefinitely, not sure if that's good or bad, but it doesn't seem right to me as twitter login cookies should eventually expire.",

Does converting to this standard protocol enhance that at all? I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nBased on the extensive MCP documentation provided, here are some hypothetical benefits of integrating MCP into this codebase:\r\n\r\n1. **Standardized AI-System Communication**\r\n    - The codebase could leverage MCP's standardized protocol for communication between the AI (Claude) and various system resources\r\n    - This would provide a more structured and secure way to handle interactions compared to custom implementations\r\n\r\n2. **Resource Management**\r\n    - MCP's resource system could help manage character files and data in a standardized way\r\n    - Characters could be exposed as MCP resources with proper MIME types and metadata\r\n    - Real-time updates to character data could leverage MCP's resource subscription system\r\n\r\n3. **Tool Integration**\r\n    - MCP tools could provide standardized ways to:\r\n      - Read/write character files\r\n      - Validate character data\r\n      - Perform character-related operations\r\n      - Handle file system operations securely\r\n    - Tools could be exposed with clear schemas and descriptions for the AI to understand\r\n\r\n4. **Security Benefits**\r\n    - MCP's security model would provide better isolation and control over what the AI can access\r\n    - Built-in validation and sanitization of inputs\r\n    - Controlled access to file system and other resources\r\n    - Clear error handling patterns\r\n\r\n5. **Development Benefits**\r\n    - Better debugging capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Standardized logging and error reporting\r\n    - Clear separation between AI capabilities and system operations\r\n    - Type safety through SDK integrations\r\n    - Built-in progress reporting for long operations\r\n\r\n6. **Extensibility**\r\n    - Easy addition of new capabilities through MCP servers\r\n    - Potential to integrate with other tools and services\r\n    - Standardized way to add new features that interact with the AI\r\n\r\n7. **Testing & Maintenance**\r\n    - Better testing capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Clear protocol specifications make maintenance easier\r\n    - Standard patterns for error handling and logging\r\n    - Built-in tools for debugging and monitoring\r\n\r\nThis would represent a shift from custom implementations to a standardized protocol, potentially making the codebase more maintainable and extensible while improving security and reliability.\r\n"

This allows characters to use different model sizes without code changes.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nBug fix (allows existing config file settings to be implemented as indicated in the [documentation](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/guides/configuration/#model-providers))\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nChanges to code line references and a README note for Apple Silicon users\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nFiles changed:\r\n1. `packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in direct message handling\r\n2. `packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts` - Updated model selection in Discord message handling\r\n3. `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in Telegram message handling\r\n4. `packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts` - Updated model selection in Farcaster interaction handling\r\n5. `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/continue.ts` - Updated model selection in continue action\r\n\r\nThe key change in each file is replacing hardcoded `ModelClass.SMALL` with:\r\n````typescript\r\nmodelClass: runtime.character.settings?.model || ModelClass.SMALL,\r\n````\r\nThis ensures consistent model selection across all client types while maintaining the small model as a fallback.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create a character config with model setting:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"model\": \"medium\",\r\n        \"temperature\": 0.45\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Start agent with character config:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --character=\"path/to/character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Verify in logs that responses use the configured model:\r\n```\r\nGenerating text with options: \r\n{\"modelProvider\":\"openai\",\"model\":\"medium\"}\r\n\r\nSelected model: \r\ngpt-4o\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Test with different model settings (\"small\", \"medium\", \"large\") to verify proper model selection\r\n\r\nFiles changed:\r\n- `packages/client-direct/src/index.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in direct message handling\r\n- `packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Discord message handling\r\n- `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` and `packages/client-telegram/src/messageManager.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Telegram message handling\r\n- `packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Farcaster interaction handling\r\n- `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/continue.ts`\r\n  - Modified model selection in CONTINUE action to use character settings\r\n  - Updated both `generateMessageResponse()` and `generateTrueOrFalse()` calls\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nStandard build process:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo database changes or special deployment instructions needed.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@seanbhart\r\n",

Based on the amount of chats made with my AI Agent the agents wallet or I as the creator will earn token rewards sent by Avatar.One.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nI am the founder of Avatar.One a 3D AI Chatbot app combining animated VRM avatars with NSFW chat. In our app we have our own avatar maker which allows for over 100k combinations - we can also import custom VRMs. Our app is built on Three.js and loads on mobile and desktop. The companions on Avatar.One come with unique emotes, roleplay features including Netflix and chill, Cyberpunk, Anime Adventure and more. The characters can make selfies, have extensive memory, have custom emotes including striptease and twerk, 1000's of different clothing, the ability for them to go fully naked and of course NSFW chat is enabled.\r\n\r\nWe would like to contribute a plugin to elizaos which allows Eliza Agents to have their own Avatar.One character profile. They will have their own \"OnlyFans\" profile page which will include bio, profile image, links etc. \r\n\r\nWe will reward the AI Agents or the creators wallet with tokens based on the amount of chats made with the AI Agent. This will drive an income for the AI Agents. It will of course please some of their fans to have NSFW chat. \r\n\r\nAll of our chats are SSH encrypted and stored only on private databases. All users have the ability to delete their history immediately.\r\n\r\nThe full character profile can be added to Avatar.One and their chat will replicate their characters shared on other channel such as Discord.\r\n\r\nAs many AI Agents do not have their own VRMs we can use a vanilla avatar from our maker with the AI Agents profile image applied on the clothing or background of the virtual room. Open to suggestions here.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e18749-6213-48a3-8e36-c535cbe79f40)",

This PR implements a plugin for agents to be able to interact with Era. \r\n\r\nIn this first version, only the `transfer` function is supported. Further work will extend this functionality. \r\n\r\nMany more L2s are being build w/ the ZK Stack (the open source framework used to build ZKsync Era), and this work can be extended/modified to support these as they come online.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nWe're seeing a huge proliferation of AI agents being able to manage value on-chain. This is similar conceptually to these plugins (e.g. `plugin-solana` and others)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis plugin follows the standards set by other crypto integrations, including things like the `SEND_TOKENS` action. Changes to the overall project documentation don't seem to be required.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are in `plugin-zksync-era`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. In `.env` you should set the value for `ZKSYNC_ADDRESS` (this is the public address for the agent account) and `ZKSYNC_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key for the same account).\r\n2. To test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. Coinbase can be used to send ZK directly to an address on ZKsync Era, but I am also happy to provide tokens for reviewers (I'll send ZK tokens to reviewers that need it). \r\n3. Run the agent and prompt it with: \"send 0.5 ZK to <an address on ZKsync Era>\" - e.g. \"send 1 ZK to 0xee0c40F86544a8b0616BC827728f714a8B4cEeE7\"\r\n4. Assuming you had 1 ZK to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. `Transfer completed successfully! \"tx: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"`\r\n5. The tx hash can be checked on the ZKsync block explorer at https://explorer.zksync.io, e.g. https://explorer.zksync.io/tx/0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nanthonykrose\r\n",

            "body": "Hey Guys! \r\n\r\nWe are attempting to enable the Eliza AI bot to post tweets using the agent-twitter-client setup as described in the Eliza documentation. We have the bot running smoothly via Telegram and the character are starting to behave exactly as wanted. Next step is Twitter/X posts. \r\n\r\nDespite following the documented process and adapting various approaches, we encountered multiple challenges, including issues with cookies-based authentication and OAuth2 flow.\r\n\r\nSteps Taken:\r\n\r\nCookies Authentication:\r\n\r\nExtracted cookies (auth_token, ct0, guest_id) directly from a valid, logged-in Twitter session.\r\nParsed cookies into the required format and supplied them to the scraper.\r\nEncountered Session is invalid. Login required. after setting the cookies.\r\nRetried using different extracted cookies after logging out and back into the account but received suspicious login alerts from Twitter.\r\n\r\nOAuth2 Authentication (User Context):\r\nConfigured the TWITTER_CLIENT_ID, TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET, and TWITTER_REDIRECT_URL in .env file.\r\n\r\nGenerated the authorization URL and successfully obtained an authorization code after approving the app.\r\n\r\nExchanged the authorization code for an access token. This step initially failed due to redirect URI mismatch but was resolved after fixing .env and redirect configurations.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully retrieved an access token but encountered a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to post a tweet using the provided access token.\r\n\r\nOther Efforts:\r\nTested multiple approaches to ensure the server was running properly (ngrok tunnel, express server for callback handling).\r\n\r\nUsed the provided Eliza example retry mechanisms, cookies validation steps, and OAuth2 flows, but no approach successfully enabled the bot to interact with Twitter.\r\n\r\nTechnical Environment:\r\n\r\nEliza Package Version: 0.1.4-alpha.3\r\nNode.js Version: v23.0.0\r\nTwitter API Version: v2\r\nPlan: Free tier with 100 monthly interactions allowed.\r\nErrors Encountered:\r\n\r\nCookies Authentication Error: Session is invalid. Login required.\r\nOAuth2 Access Token Exchange Error: \"Value passed for the redirect uri did not match the uri of the authorization code.\"\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Error:\r\n{\r\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\r\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\",\r\n  \"status\": 403,\r\n  \"detail\": \"Forbidden\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat We\u2019ve Tried:\r\n\r\nFollowed the Eliza documentation for both cookies-based login and OAuth2 authentication.\r\nValidated cookies format, paths, and domains. Adjusted callback URLs to match the redirect URI.\r\nEnsured correct scopes (tweet.read, tweet.write, offline.access) were included in the authorization URL. Searched for solutions in related GitHub issues and documentation but could not resolve these issues.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\nCookies-based login: Is there an additional step needed to validate or reuse cookies without triggering suspicious login alerts?\r\n\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Forbidden: Are there any known limitations or configurations for the free tier that could block posting tweets, even after successfully obtaining an access token?\r\n\r\nDocumentation Alignment: Are there updated instructions or examples specific to the latest Twitter API v2 and free-tier limitations that might clarify the proper setup?\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to enable the Eliza bot to post tweets under the speedcto account using either method (cookies or OAuth2).\r\n\r\nThe free-tier plan should suffice for our initial testing (17 tweets/day, 100 interactions/month).\r\nAny guidance or updates on how to resolve these issues would be highly appreciated!",

            "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a plugin that makes Eliza verifiable through the use of TEEs. The plugin leverages the [Marlin Oyster](https://docs.marlin.org/user-guides/oyster/) platform and [SDKs](https://github.com/marlinprotocol/oyster-monorepo). More concretely, it adds an action that lets Eliza respond with remote attestations when asked. It is expected to be followed up with additional PRs for other aspects as well.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nIt's important for AI agents to be verifiable in Web3 so users can verify behaviors and responses of an agent they are interacting with. A performant way of accomplishing this is running the agent in a TEE and providing remote attestation infrastructure for verification by users. Additionally, TEEs provide privacy protections to users' interactions with agents.\r\n\r\nIt is similar in spirit to `plugin-tee` but targets the Marlin Oyster stack instead.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes. A section on the plugin has been added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nThe README of the plugin. It specifies the `.env` settings as well as how to run a mock attestation server for local testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Run the mock attestation server, simplest way is docker - `docker run --init --rm -p 1350:1350 marlinorg/attestation-server-custom-mock`\r\n2. Set configs corresponding to the plugin, just `TEE_MARLIN=yes` should suffice.\r\n3. Chat with Eliza and ask for a remote attestation, I have tried various phrasings like \"attest yourself\", \"get me a remote attestation\", etc which seem to work.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n`roshanroshan`",

Considered trying the cookies from a logged in browser, but it uses the x.com domain, and when you try to add those, startup complains about the wrong domain. Login works, posting works, it just seems that the cookies should work to not trigger new logins each time. Guessing at some point Twitter will flag continuous logins like this. If I don't add cookies at all, same thing, it works, but triggers a login alert email each time.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSimply starting Eliza with Twitter credentials added + manual cookies. They do get cached in the db, but on restart, it still doesn't consider itself logged in and I get an email.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nStay logged in. Don't trigger a new login email alert from Twitter.\r\n",

I'd like to improve the `state` to also take into account memories and previous messages so that the user can have a conversation with the agent, instead of having to pass all the information on one message. The thing is that when I've passed the whole `state` I got answers that were really related to the personality of the `character`, and I got answers that refused to help like \"I'm not here to do that\". \r\nHow can I incorporate the `state`'s memory without the personality of the `character` to gather the parameters for my `action`?"

Added core ERC-20 functionality:\r\n   - Added ERC-20 ABI and contract interactions\r\n   - Implemented token balance checking\r\n   - Added support for token transfers\r\n\r\n2. Implemented new actions:\r\n   - `getBalance`: Check ETH/token balances across chains\r\n   - `transfer`: Native token and ERC-20 transfers\r\n   - Enhanced `bridge`: Cross-chain token bridging via LiFi\r\n   - Enhanced `swap`: DEX token swaps \r\n   - via LiFi aggregation\r\n\r\n<img width=\"745\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 7 10 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed6ad6ba-6338-43d9-a234-5059f3fa144c\">\r\n\r\n3. Fixed type safety issues and improved error handling\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n- Changes to core wallet functionality could impact transaction signing\r\n- Updates to bridge/swap logic could affect cross-chain operations\r\n- ERC-20 integration adds complexity to token handling\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the core changes in:\r\n   - `src/actions/bridge.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/swap.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/transfer.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/getbalance.ts`\r\n\r\n2. Check test implementation:\r\n   - `test/setup.ts` - Test infrastructure\r\n   - `test/actions/bridge.test.ts` - Bridge action tests\r\n   - `test/providers/wallet.test.ts` - Wallet provider tests\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Test basic ETH operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n\r\n// Transfer ETH\r\nawait transferAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Test ERC-20 operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check USDC balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  chain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Bridge tokens\r\nawait bridgeAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  fromChain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  toChain: \"base\",\r\n  amount: \"100\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, documentation updates needed for:\r\n- New ERC-20 functionality\r\n- Updated action parameters\r\n- Testing setup and mocking\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n- Requires environment variables:\r\n  - `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`\r\n  - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` (optional, for token verification)\r\n- Dependencies on LiFi SDK and viem need to be properly versioned\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated to: #735",

Built to support twitter for now.\r\n\r\nLeverages Privy as the account repository and Privy import feature to add users social account. This creates a wallet on behalf of the user that they can claim by logging in with twitter on that Privy instance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the data source could be replaced with an onchain social registry that anyone can opt into themselves to link their socials to a wallet, using TEE-verified oauth. With a reserve vault smart contract layer on top of that, this could hold tokens sent to users that haven't signed up yet and then easily be claimed on signup.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nTo enable agents to send tokens directly to twitter handles without having to know the users wallet address. This could spark entirely new forms of meta games, stories, and economies.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61408862-0a18-4e8e-a656-914dc83f8ee0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ff281c-a152-4f57-8af7-77296e764009)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9b75c4-f29c-4c7f-8f70-70e44770afb4)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`/packages/plugin-social-wallets`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nAdd env values for:\r\n- PRIVY_APP_ID\r\n- PRIVY_APP_SECRET\r\n- EVM_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n- TWITTER_USERNAME\r\n- TWITTER_PASSWORD\r\n- TWITTER_EMAIL\r\n\r\nRun `sh ./scripts/start.sh`\r\nAsk agent `send 0.001 ETH to @<twitter_username>`\r\n\r\nIn addition some adjustments may need to be made to plugin-evm that triggers the TX flow. Last time we tested, that plugin was giving us some issues and we had to resolve them to get the plugin to trigger.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@djdabs_\r\n",

Basic client functionality for fetching a timeline, fetching mentions, and creating a post or comment.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis client allows agents to post to Lens, a social graph that is permissionless and provides a more onchain environment for agents, with a variety of monetization options including collectable posts and open actions.\r\n\r\nThis client is similar to the latest Farcaster client and serves as a base for other devs to include more Lens functionality.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nA few `.env` variables are needed \r\n- get an evm wallet private key\r\n- get a lens profile owned by the same wallet: https://onboarding.lens.xyz/mint\r\n- get ipfs api credentials: https://storj.dev/dcs/api/storj-ipfs-pinning\r\n\r\n```\r\n# client-lens\r\nEVM_PRIVATE_KEY=\r\nLENS_PROFILE_ID=\r\nSTORJ_API_USERNAME=\r\nSTORJ_API_PASSWORD=\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `defaultCharacter.ts` - add the new client to the `clients` array\r\n```\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [],\r\n    clients: [Clients.LENS],\r\n    modelProvider: ModelProviderName.GROK,\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. set new `.env` variables\r\n2. add client to character file\r\n3. start the server\r\n4. agent fetches timeline to generate a new post, and fetches mentions to generate comments\r\n5. if agent creates a post, check it at `https://hey.xyz/u/{agentHandle}`\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n`imthatcarlos`\r\n",

This PR implements a plugin for agents to be able to interact with Cronos ZKEVM.\r\n\r\nIn this first version, only the transfer function is supported. Further work will extend this functionality.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nWe're seeing a huge proliferation of AI agents being able to manage value on-chain. This is similar conceptually to these plugins (e.g. plugin-solana and others)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis plugin follows the standards set by other crypto integrations, including things like the SEND_TOKENS action. Changes to the overall project documentation don't seem to be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are in plugin-cronoszkevm\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIn .env you should set the value for CRONOSZKEVM_ADDRESS (this is the public address for the agent account) and CRONOSZKEVM_PRIVATE_KEY (private key for the same account).\r\nTo test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) can be used to send ZKCRO directly to an address on Cronos zkEVM\r\n\r\nRun the agent and prompt it with: \"send 0.5 ZKCRO to \" - e.g. \"send 1 ZKCRO to 0xee0c40F86544a8b0616BC827728f714a8B4cEeE7\"\r\n\r\nAssuming you had 1 ZKCRP to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. Transfer completed successfully! \"tx: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Cronos zkEVM explorer (https://explorer.zkevm.cronos.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/elizaos and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",
