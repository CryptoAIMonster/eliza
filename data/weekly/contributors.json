The fix uses `evaluators?.includes` to handle potential null values. Since `strictNullChecks` is disabled, similar issues likely exist elsewhere. I enabled `strictNullChecks` in the core package and kept changes minimal, focusing on the core runtime. Downstream TypeScript errors were addressed with `ts-expect-error` pragmas. This approach facilitates the incremental adoption of stricter type safety.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nTypescript related\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why. If there is a related issue, it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThe app crashes occasionally when `parseJsonArrayFromText` returns null in core runtime logic.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nIntegration tests should catch any issues. The only real change here is a null key check on evaluators in the evaluator handler loop.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nStart the app, make some prompts, make sure normal prompts work as expected.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nI thought it would be neat to create agents that can fetch the weather.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n\r\n- Add OpenWeather plugin setup instructions\r\n- Document required API key configuration\r\n- Add usage examples for weather checking\r\n- Update plugin list in main documentation\r\n- Add pricing/rate limit considerations\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- Review the plugin implementation in `plugin-openweather/src/`\r\n- Check the main action implementation in `actions/getCurrentWeather.ts`\r\n- Verify API service in `service.ts`\r\n- Review type definitions in `types.ts`\r\n- Check template handling in `template.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Set up environment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run agent locally and test natural language queries:\r\n\r\n- \"What's the current weather in Toronto?\"\r\n- \"What's the weather like in Paris?\"\r\n- \"What's the weather like?\"\r\n\r\n3. Verify error handling:\r\n\r\n- Try with invalid cities\r\n- Test API timeout scenarios\r\n- Check rate limit handling\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1276\" alt=\"eliza-openweather-plugin\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb5b1ea-5d7d-4fd9-b5de-5f726b155e41\" />\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nkylebuildsstuff\r\n",

This caused:\r\n- The original valid UUID to be unnecessarily converted\r\n- Generation of a new, different UUID\r\n- Failed memory retrievals due to UUID mismatch\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5cbe780-59ab-4e19-9f68-f9cee9f4fa33)\r\nTo further show case the problem, orginal room ID: `ad22e47a-3fd0-05dc-8791-8fba9e475378` was altered by `stringToUuid()` to `8e9b5550-ca28-0f3c-a1f4-f13c2cdf3dca`, leading to memories failed to be fetched by `runtime.messageManager.getMemories`.\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"agentId\": \"b850bc30-45f8-0041-a00a-83df46d8555d\",\r\n  \"roomId\": \"8e9b5550-ca28-0f3c-a1f4-f13c2cdf3dca\",\r\n  \"memories\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Defensive Programming: The API server was not validating UUID parameters, which led to:\r\n- No validation of input format\r\n- Silent failures when invalid UUIDs were provided\r\n\r\nThis PR implements proper input validation and error handling, making the API more robust and developer-friendly.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the UUID type validation function introduced at packages/core/src/uuid.ts\r\n2. Review the new validateUUIDParams function in packages/client-direct/src/api.ts\r\n3. Check the implementation across all API endpoints that use agentId or roomId\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Test `/agents/:agentId/:roomId/memories` endpoint:\r\n\r\n- With valid UUIDs - should work normally\r\n- With invalid agentId - should return 400 with appropriate error message\r\n- With invalid roomId - should return 400 with appropriate error message\r\n\r\n2. Test other endpoints with agentId parameter:\r\n\r\n- `/agents/:agentId`\r\n- `/agents/:agentId/set`\r\n- `/agents/:agentId/channels`\r\n\r\n3. Verify error messages from 1. are clear and helpful.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n### After\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deployment, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste command line output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Please specify deploy instructions if there is something more than the automated steps. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for the contributor role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

                "body": "Analysis:\r\n\r\n1. Character set expansion:\r\n- The original regex only allowed alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and whitespace.\r\n- The new regex significantly expands the allowed character set:\r\n  - \\p{L}: Any kind of letter from any language\r\n  - \\p{N}: Any kind of numeric character in any script\r\n  - \\s: Whitespace (same as before)\r\n  - -_./:?=&: Allows hyphens, underscores, periods, forward slashes, colons, question marks, equal signs, and ampersands\r\n\r\n2. Potential security implications:\r\n- The expanded character set could potentially allow for more types of injections or attacks, particularly:\r\n  - Path traversal attacks (due to allowing '/' and '.')\r\n  - URL manipulation (due to allowing '/', ':', '?', '=', and '&')\r\n  - Potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) if the content is rendered in HTML, especially due to allowing '&' which could be used in HTML entities\r\n\r\n3. Unicode support:\r\n- The addition of the 'u' flag enables full Unicode support, which could potentially allow for Unicode-based evasion techniques.\r\n\r\n4. Global flag:\r\n- Both versions use the global flag 'g', which is appropriate for replacing all occurrences.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**: While the new regex allows for more natural language input (including non-Latin scripts) and common URL components, it also introduces potential security risks. The change could enable malicious activities such as path traversal, URL manipulation, and potentially XSS if proper output encoding is not implemented.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate risks:\r\n1. Ensure strong input validation and sanitization beyond this regex.\r\n2. Implement proper output encoding when rendering the content.\r\n3. Consider the context where this messageContent is used and adjust the allowed characters accordingly.\r\n4. If URL components are not needed, consider removing '/', ':', '?', '=', and '&' from the allowed set.\r\n\r\nIt's crucial to thoroughly test this change and implement additional security measures appropriate for the specific use case of this messageContent."

            "body": "When a user wants to verify a log's signature using a public key, they first need to ensure that the public key was indeed generated within the TEE. This requires the user to verify the correctness of the remote attestation. However, users obtain the remote attestation by accessing the `/verifiable/attestation` endpoint, which calls the `generateAttestation` function. This function doesn't validate the agent ID and public key from the user's request, but instead directly generates a remote attestation. This doesn't prove that the public key corresponds to a private key generated within the TEE.\r\nAssuming TLS communication is established between the user and Eliza, I propose two correct approaches:\r\n\r\nThe user provides the agent_id, subject, and publicKey required for private key generation to the `generateAttestation` function. Within this function, a key pair is generated using deriveKey, and the resulting public key is compared with the publicKey parameter. If they match, an attestation report should be generated with the publicKey included in the report.\r\nSince Eliza has already stored the publicKey in the SQLite database during initial registerAgent, if we can ensure that the SQLite database content is encrypted and cannot be tampered with by software outside the TEE, the `generateAttestation` function can directly read the publicKey from the database using the agent_id, subject, and keypath. It then compares this with the publicKey in the user's request, and if they match, generates an attestation report.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, if someone sends a log to a user with a signature generated by a private key from outside the TEE, and provides this forged public key to the user, when the user requests an attestation through the `/verifiable/attestation` endpoint with the agent_id and corresponding public key, Eliza running in the TEE will directly send a valid attestation to the user. This allows users to be deceived\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @lightning-li in https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1369#discussion_r1908145251_\r\n            ",

It is self-contained. The plugin globally wraps axios in a SOCKS proxy opened up by the Anyone Client, this is within `packages/plugin-anyone/src/services`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nTo thoroughly test, another plugin was made but not committed on this PR to check for the users current IP. Here the user can check their IP, startup the anyone client and check their IP again which should be different as it is routed through the network. By extension, this should therefore work for other plugins users may use that uses axios. \r\nAnother plugin was created to check the IP and added to the main agent `index.ts`. Cloning this [branch](https://github.com/Saundr21/eliza/tree/testing/anyone-ip) should do most of the testing steps automatically.\r\n\r\nThe image outlines how the plugin works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"915\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e58acf59-d109-4256-b59c-e3f3a21cfe39\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

Insufficient Error Handling\r\n**Location**: Multiple instances throughout the code\r\n**Impact**: High\r\n**Example**:\r\n```typescript\r\ndb.init()\r\n    .then(() => {\r\n        elizaLogger.success(\"Successfully connected to PostgreSQL database\");\r\n    })\r\n    .catch((error) => {\r\n        elizaLogger.error(\"Failed to connect to PostgreSQL:\", error);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n**Issues**:\r\n- No proper error recovery mechanism\r\n- Continues execution after critical failures\r\n- Incomplete error information logging\r\n- No distinction between different types of database errors\r\n\r\n### 3. Unsafe File Operations\r\n**Location**: `loadCharacters()` function\r\n**Impact**: High\r\n**Vulnerability**:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst content = tryLoadFile(tryPath);\r\nif (content !== null) {\r\n    resolvedPath = tryPath;\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Risks**:\r\n- Directory traversal attacks\r\n- File system access outside intended directories\r\n- Race conditions in file operations\r\n- No file content validation before parsing\r\n\r\n### 4. Insecure Database Initialization\r\n**Location**: `initializeDatabase()` function\r\n**Impact**: High\r\n**Issue**:\r\n```typescript\r\nif (process.env.POSTGRES_URL) {\r\n    const db = new PostgresDatabaseAdapter({\r\n        connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL,\r\n        parseInputs: true,\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Vulnerabilities**:\r\n- No connection pooling\r\n- Unencrypted database URLs in environment\r\n- No SSL/TLS enforcement\r\n- SQL injection risks with parseInputs:true\r\n\r\n### 5. Unvalidated Plugin Loading\r\n**Location**: Character loading and plugin initialization\r\n**Impact**: Critical\r\n**Vulnerability**:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst importedPlugins = await Promise.all(\r\n    character.plugins.map(async (plugin) => {\r\n        const importedPlugin = await import(plugin);\r\n        return importedPlugin.default;\r\n    })\r\n);\r\n```\r\n**Risks**:\r\n- Remote code execution through malicious plugins\r\n- Memory leaks from unmanaged plugin resources\r\n- System compromise through untrusted code execution\r\n- No plugin signature verification\r\n\r\n## Moderate Issues\r\n\r\n### 6. Insufficient Input Validation\r\n**Location**: Throughout client initialization\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n**Example**:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst clientTypes: string[] = character.clients?.map((str) => str.toLowerCase()) || [];\r\n```\r\n**Issues**:\r\n- No validation of client type strings\r\n- Potential prototype pollution\r\n- Missing input sanitization\r\n- Undefined behavior with invalid inputs\r\n\r\n### 7. Inadequate Logging\r\n**Location**: Throughout the codebase\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n**Issue**:\r\n```typescript\r\nelizaLogger.debug(`Fetching ${url}`);\r\n```\r\n**Problems**:\r\n- Inconsistent logging levels\r\n- Potential sensitive data exposure in logs\r\n- No log rotation mechanism\r\n- Missing structured logging format\r\n\r\n### 8. Port Security Issues\r\n**Location**: `checkPortAvailable()` and server initialization\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n**Vulnerability**:\r\n```typescript\r\nwhile (!(await checkPortAvailable(serverPort))) {\r\n    serverPort++;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Risks**:\r\n- Port scanning vulnerabilities\r\n- Race conditions in port binding\r\n- No maximum port limit\r\n- Potential privilege escalation\r\n\r\n## Minor Issues\r\n\r\n### 9. Memory Management\r\n**Location**: Cache initialization and management\r\n**Impact**: Low\r\n**Issue**: No explicit memory limits or cleanup mechanisms for cache storage\r\n\r\n### 10. Type Safety Issues\r\n**Location**: Throughout the codebase\r\n**Impact**: Low\r\n**Example**: Loose type checking in multiple functions and implicit any types\r\n\r\n## Performance Issues\r\n\r\n### 11. Resource Management\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n- No connection pooling for databases\r\n- Unbounded cache growth potential\r\n- No rate limiting for API calls\r\n- Uncontrolled concurrent operations\r\n\r\n### 12. Scaling Limitations\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n- Single-threaded operation for critical paths\r\n- No horizontal scaling capabilities\r\n- Potential memory leaks in long-running operations\r\n- No backup or failover mechanisms\r\n\r\n## Impact Assessment Matrix\r\n\r\n| Issue | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score |\r\n|-------|------------|--------|------------|\r\n| Secret Management | High | Critical | 10 |\r\n| Error Handling | High | High | 8 |\r\n| File Operations | Medium | High | 7 |\r\n| Database Security | High | High | 8 |\r\n| Plugin Security | Medium | Critical | 9 |\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n- Total Critical Issues: 5\r\n- Total High Impact Issues: 3\r\n- Total Moderate Issues: 4\r\n- Total Minor Issues: 2\r\n- Total Performance Issues: 2\r\n\r\nEach issue requires immediate attention based on its risk score and potential impact on system security and stability.",

            "body": "# About\r\n\r\nIntroducing the **`@elizaos/plugin-depin`** plugin, a new addition to the Eliza Agent Framework that provides Perception and Action capabilities via DePINs.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n- This is a new plugin and does not interfere with existing functionality or other plugins.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR creates the **`@elizaos/plugin-depin`** plugin, which empowers Eliza AI agents with advanced capabilities to interact with decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs). This plugin acts as a bridge between AI agents and the real world, enabling real-time data access and device control.\r\n\r\n### Key Features:\r\n1. **DePINScan Integration**:\r\n   - Fetches and caches real-time data from the IoTeX DePINScan API.\r\n   - Provides aggregated daily metrics, detailed project data, and market information for DePIN projects.\r\n\r\n2. **Weather Integration**:\r\n   - Nubila APIs to fetch and analyze current weather and forecasts for specified locations.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Features**: \r\n  - A completely new plugin added to the Eliza Agent Framework.\r\n- **Documentation**: \r\n  - Detailed setup instructions provided in the README to help users integrate and use the plugin effectively.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThe IoTeX team provides the DEPIN+AI layer to bridge decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) with artificial intelligence, enabling transformative real-world applications. **`@elizaos/plugin-depin`** plugin is designed to expand the capabilities of Eliza agents by connecting them with DePINs, enabling them to process real-world data and perform actionable tasks.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes include the plugin's README, which serves as comprehensive documentation for setup and usage. No additional documentation changes are required.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the plugin's code for integration with DePINScan, Mapbox, and Nubila APIs.\r\n2. Follow the README's configuration and setup instructions to verify the plugin's functionality.\r\n3. Test both actions (`DEPIN_PROJECTS` and `CURRENT_WEATHER`) to ensure correct behavior.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Test `DEPIN_PROJECTS` action with:\r\n   - Query token prices, market caps, and valuations.\r\n   - Compare metrics and filter projects by categories and chains.\r\n   - Ask device statistics and earnings data.\r\n   - Question about specific DePIN project details.\r\n\r\n2. Test `CURRENT_WEATHER` action to:\r\n   - Fetch current weather conditions, temperature, and forecasts\r\n   - Analyze and answer weather-related questions, including patterns and trends.\r\n   - Ensure proper handling of weather-themed queries, including memes and visual content generation.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### DePIN project info:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 1 22 08\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f302c8fc-6097-458f-89bc-25d716dc3325\" />\r\n\r\n### Weather data \r\n\r\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 1 22 31\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/056323e2-db96-44da-97e0-eed10f41bf88\" />\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n**nikita_zhou**",

            "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\nThis PR relates to the following issues:\r\n\r\nObsidian Integration #302 \r\n\r\nThe development and maintenance of the @elizaos/plugin-obsidian package, focusing on enhancing elizaOS agents integration capabilities with Obsidian vaults.\r\n\r\n### Key features include:\r\n\r\n1. Deep traversal of Obsidian notes:\r\n   - Implementing hierarchical note structure analysis\r\n   - Enabling traversal of note links and backlinks\r\n   - Storing hierarchy data in memory for efficient access\r\n\r\n2. Advanced search functionality:\r\n   - Full-text search across all vault files\r\n   - Support for regex patterns and context-aware searches\r\n   - Integration with Obsidian's native search capabilities using Obsidian's Rest API\r\n\r\n3. Obsidian memory store integration:\r\n   - Building and maintaining a knowledge base from vault notes\r\n   - Implementing efficient data structures for quick retrieval\r\n\r\n4. Naval database integration as an example:\r\n   - Demonstrating how to import and structure obsidian notes\r\n   - Showcasing integration of Naval's wisdom and quotes\r\n   - Creating a knowledge base from Naval's vault notes\r\n   - Naval's character json file is included in the PR\r\n\r\nThese enhancements aim to provide users with powerful tools for knowledge management and retrieval within their Obsidian vaults, while also demonstrating the plugin's extensibility for integrating external data sources.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow - This is a plugin package that integrates with Obsidian vault functionality using the Obsidian Rest API.\r\n\r\nMain risks include:\r\n\r\n- File system operations safety\r\n- Data integrity when reading/writing notes\r\n- Performance with large vaults\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR maintains the Obsidian plugin package which provides integration between ELIZA OS agents and Obsidian vaults. The plugin enables:\r\n\r\n- File and note management within Obsidian vaults\r\n- Search functionality using Omnisearch\r\n- Note traversal and knowledge base features\r\n- Active note operations and file manipulation\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality):\r\n\r\n- Obsidian Vault operations (listing files, directory management)\r\n- Note management (content retrieval, metadata handling)\r\n- Search capabilities\r\n- File operations (read, write, update)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- [X] My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\nObsisdian plugin is documented in the package README.md which includes:\r\n\r\n- Features documentation\r\n- Usage examples\r\n- API documentation\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the main plugin definition in `src/index.ts`\r\n2. Check individual action implementations in `src/actions/`\r\n3. Verify the API documentation in README.md\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Setup Testing Environment\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Install dependencies\r\n   pnpm install\r\n\r\n   # Run tests\r\n   pnpm test\r\n\r\n   # For development with watch mode\r\n   pnpm run test:watch\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Core API Tests (`src/tests/obsidianClient.test.ts`)\r\n   - Test Authentication:\r\n     - Verify successful connection to Obsidian API\r\n     - Test authentication failure scenarios\r\n\r\n   - Test Note Operations:\r\n     - List all notes in vault\r\n     - Get specific note content by path\r\n     - Get active note content\r\n     - Verify note metadata and frontmatter parsing\r\n\r\n   - Test File Operations:\r\n     - List all files in vault\r\n     - List files in specific directory\r\n     - Read file contents\r\n     - Test file write/update operations\r\n\r\n   - Test Search Functionality:\r\n     - Plain text search: `obsidianProvider.search('query', 'plaintext')`\r\n     - Dataview queries: `obsidianProvider.search('TABLE field FROM \"folder\"', 'dataview')`\r\n     - JSON Logic queries: `obsidianProvider.search({ var: 'field' }, 'jsonlogic')`\r\n     - Keyword search: `obsidianProvider.searchKeywords('keyword1 OR keyword2')`\r\n\r\n   - Test Command Integration:\r\n     - List available Obsidian commands\r\n     - Execute commands through API\r\n\r\n3. Error Handling Tests\r\n   - Test API connection failures\r\n   - Verify error handling for invalid requests\r\n   - Check error messages for missing files/notes\r\n   - Test authentication error scenarios\r\n\r\n4. Integration Testing\r\n   - Test plugin integration with Obsidian app\r\n   - Verify real-time updates and file synchronization\r\n   - Test concurrent operations handling\r\n   - Verify memory management and cleanup\r\n\r\nExpected test results:\r\n\r\n- All unit tests should pass\r\n- API endpoints should respond with correct data\r\n- Error scenarios should be properly handled\r\n- No memory leaks in long-running operations\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

Further, such capability is ideally extendable by templating. \r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR basically makes the original #391 work end to end. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n1. Add more meaningful logs to json parser.\r\n2. Fix the evaluator flow in #391 , making sure goals and knowledge can be generated and memorized. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

FXN will iterate over it, and continue building agent-agent coordination on Eliza. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

Follow the steps below if needed. \r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Update operators in packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts by pasting your user id. \r\n2. `pnpm build && pnpm start`\r\n3. `pnpm start:client `\r\n4.

This feature is particularly useful for organizations using Eliza to manage their Twitter accounts, as it provides an additional layer of control by requiring approval before any content goes live.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThe approval mechanism is being introduced to address the needs of organizations and teams that require greater control over the content being published via their Twitter accounts. By adding this feature, we enable a structured review process to ensure that tweets align with brand guidelines, organizational policies, and quality standards before they are made public.\r\n\r\n#### Context or Related Work\r\n- Use Case in Organizations: Many organizations rely on collaborative content creation but need an approval layer to prevent accidental or inappropriate tweets from being posted.\r\n- Extending Eliza's Utility: This feature enhances Eliza's value for enterprise-level usage by making it a more robust tool for social media management.\r\n- Precedent in Social Media Management Tools: Other tools like Buffer or Hootsuite provide similar approval workflows, demonstrating its importance for structured social media management.\r\n- Consistency and Accountability: Helps maintain a record of approvals and ensures accountability for all published content.\r\n- User Feedback: This feature was designed in response to user feedback requesting an approval mechanism for improved content governance.\r\nThis enhancement aligns with the broader goal of making Eliza a versatile and enterprise-friendly platform for managing social media channels effectively.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![IMG_1686](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a3423a9-25eb-4cc0-9492-9059ac4d2da3)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n### After\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deployment, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste command line output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Please specify deploy instructions if there is something more than the automated steps. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for the contributor role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

Previously, the model would be initialized multiple times during character knowledge processing, leading to high RAM usage (8-12GB & even more). With this change, the model is initialized once and reused, reducing RAM usage to less than 1GB.\r\n\r\nThe root issue lies in the FastEmbed library's initialization and Eliza's reinitialization:\r\n```typescript\r\nstatic async init({\r\n    model = EmbeddingModel.BGESmallENV15,\r\n    executionProviders = [ExecutionProvider.CPU],\r\n    maxLength = 512,\r\n    cacheDir = \"local_cache\",\r\n    showDownloadProgress = true,\r\n}) {\r\n    const session = await ort.InferenceSession.create(modelPath, {\r\n      executionProviders,\r\n      graphOptimizationLevel: \"all\",\r\n    });\r\n    return new FlagEmbedding(tokenizer, session, model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nref: https://github.com/Anush008/fastembed-js\r\n\r\nWhen this init function is called, The ort inference session allocates new CPU and RAM resources that don't get cleared by default or by garbage collector. In Eliza's code, we are calling this, again and again, basically ram usage became directly proportional to the no of lines in the character's file knowledge.\r\n\r\n```\r\nelizaLogger.debug(\"Initializing BGE embedding model...\");\r\n\r\nconst embeddingModel = await FlagEmbedding.init({\r\n    cacheDir: cacheDir,\r\n    model: EmbeddingModel.BGESmallENV15,\r\n    // BGE-small-en-v1.5 specific settings\r\n    maxLength: 512, // BGE's context window\r\n});\r\n\r\nelizaLogger.debug(\"Generating embedding for input:\", {\r\n    inputLength: input.length,\r\n    inputPreview: input.slice(0, 100) + \"...\",\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this could be fixed in FastEmbed js by updating onnxruntime-node and using its release() method, that approach needs more testing and planning. This PR provides a quick and reliable fix by ensuring we create only one model instance.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (optimizing existing features for better performance)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation as this is an internal optimization that doesn't affect the API or user interface.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the newly added `EmbeddingModelManager.ts`\r\n2. Check the modifications in `embedding.ts` where the local embedding logic has been updated\r\n3. Monitor RAM usage during character knowledge processing\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Process a character file with substantial knowledge content\r\n   - Verify that RAM usage remains under 1GB\r\n   - Confirm that embeddings are still generated correctly\r\n2. Test concurrent embedding requests\r\n   - Verify that race conditions are handled properly\r\n   - Check that model initialization happens only once\r\n3. Test browser fallback\r\n   - Verify that the code still falls back to remote embedding in browser environments\r\n\r\n# Test Results\r\n### Before\r\nRAM Usage: 8-12GB during character knowledge processing\r\n\r\n### After\r\nRAM Usage: <1GB during character knowledge processing\r\n\r\n# Technical Implementation Details\r\n- Implemented singleton pattern for BGE model management\r\n- Added proper initialization locking to handle concurrent requests\r\n- Maintained existing fallback behavior and error handling\r\n- Added cleanup capabilities for proper resource management\r\n- No changes to the embedding API or external interfaces\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces two main files:\r\n1. `EmbeddingModelManager.ts` - New singleton class managing model initialization\r\n2. Modified `embedding.ts` - Updated to use the manager for local embeddings\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNo special deployment steps required. The changes are backwards compatible and will take effect automatically after deployment.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts or if you need any clarification or changes to the PR!",

This happened because the code is written to get default exports and many plugins are not doing so. They have named exports, which caused the imported plugin default to be undefined!  \r\n\r\nFixes plugin import mechanism to properly handle community-published plugins that don't use default exports. The changes:\r\n- Add proper error handling for failed imports\r\n- Support multiple plugin exports from a single file\r\n- Maintain backward compatibility with default exports\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\nBug fix - Resolves plugin import failures\r\n\r\n# Documentation Impact\r\nNo changes are needed to project documentation as this fixes implementation details without changing the public API.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where to start?\r\n1. Start with loadCharacters() function in src/[file].ts\r\n2. Focus on the plugin import logic changes\r\n3. Check error handling improvements\r\n\r\n## Testing Steps\r\n1. Test with a plugin using the default export\r\n   - Import should work as before\r\n   - Verify plugin loads correctly\r\n\r\n2. Test with community plugin (no default export)\r\n   - Create a test plugin with named exports\r\n   - Verify all valid plugins are imported\r\n   - Check console logs for proper import tracking\r\n\r\n3.

            "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\nNo specific issue or ticket.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow \u2013 The changes are isolated to a new plugin addition and do not affect existing functionality.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nSpheron is the largest GPU supercompute network, designed to deploy workloads in a modular and decentralized way. Our platform offers developers a robust infrastructure for running various workloads efficiently, leveraging the power of decentralized systems. With Spheron, users can deploy a wide range of templates and workload, making it a flexible solution for diverse computational needs.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin to the Spheron ecosystem that allows users to deploy specific templates (e.g., Ollama, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, and Heurist Miner) on Spheronk. The plugin serves as a foundation to make workload deployment with natural language, enabling the creation and deployment of additional agents or workloads, such as deploying one Eliza agent from another. This functionality significantly expands the Eliza plugin ecosystem's potential and enhances its utility.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Addition of a new plugin (non-breaking change).\r\n- The plugin can be imported separately to enable the functionality without affecting other modules.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nSpheron is building the largest GPU supercompute network, designed to deploy workloads in a super-modular way on our decentralized infrastructure. By integrating this plugin, we simplify deploying various supported templates and lay the groundwork for more complex deployments and agent-based interactions. This addition is a meaningful step in growing the Eliza plugin ecosystem and offering more powerful, modular tools for our users.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Documentation has been updated in the `adapter-reclaim` README.\r\n- No further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nAll the changes are in `plugin-spheron` directory\r\nBegin by following the steps outlined in the detailed testing steps below.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Create a wallet using the instructions here: [Spheron Docs: Create new wallet](https://docs.spheron.network/user-guide/deploy-your-app#step-2-create-a-new-wallet-using-the-cli).\r\n\r\n2. Request test tokens:  \r\n   - Obtain test USDT and ETH tokens from the team.  \r\n   - Share your wallet address with me, and I\u2019ll allocate the necessary tokens.\r\n\r\n3. Export your wallet's private key:  \r\n   Refer to the guide: [Spheron Doc: Export private key from wallet](https://docs.spheron.network/user-guide/protocol-cli#export-the-private-key-of-wallet).\r\n\r\n4. Configure the environment variables using your private key and wallet address:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   SPHERON_PRIVATE_KEY=\r\n   SPHERON_PROVIDER_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:3040\r\n   SPHERON_WALLET_ADDRESS=\r\n   ```\r\n 5. Deploy a character using the command:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"\r\n    ```\r\n 6. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n 7. Interact with Eliza to initiate a deployment. Example:\r\n    ```\r\n    User: \"deploy a jupyter notebook with 2 RTX4090 GPUs, 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM, and 100GB storage for 3 hours.\"\r\n    Agent: \"Jupyter Notebook deployed with specs as requested for 3 hours.\"\r\n    Agent: \"Deployment created and ready!\r\n        Lease ID: 72837\r\n        Access URLs: provider.abc.com:23283 for 8888\"\r\n    ```\r\n \r\n## Discord username\r\n---> rekpero",

If the TEE node running the specified AI agent shuts down for any reason, another TEE node can download the AI agent's \"life\" data from the chain and resume its operation. This data is encrypted by the TEE, ensuring that only the same version of TEE Eliza can download and restore the agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Improvements\r\n  * Modify the core package to enable on-chain da upload/download\r\n* Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n  * Add blockchain adopter to store on-chain information\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why.

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nLearn our design:\r\n\r\n1. Defining Eliza\u2019s Ghost\r\n\r\n    Eliza is a highly abstract framework. The core data structure related to its Ghost is its memory, which includes:\r\n\r\n    Agent metadata defined in the character.\r\n    Message data generated through interaction with the outside world.\r\n\r\n    Together, these form its \u201cpersonality\u201d and \u201cmemory.\u201d As Eliza expands, it may also hold a wallet, and the underlying key is one of the key pieces of its Ghost data.\r\n\r\n2. Serialization and Encryption of Ghost\r\n\r\n    Once the Ghost is defined, it needs to be extracted from Eliza\u2019s specific implementation and uploaded externally. Thus, a suitable serialization way is required.\r\n\r\n    We define a Blob Chain data structure:\r\n    * Each Blob\u2019s payload can store multiple memory entries.\r\n    * The Blob is encrypted using TEE Eliza\u2019s key, inaccessible to other versions.\r\n    * Blobs are sequentially linked in a chain. (Future expansions could use a DAG structure? Gosh fork? Who knows! \ud83d\ude02)\r\n\r\n    By simply storing the latest Blob, all memories can be retrieved.\r\n\r\n3. Uploading and Downloading Ghost\r\n\r\n    When Eliza is launched as a new AI agent:\r\n    It registers on-chain with a decentralized identity registration smart contract. Each Eliza has a unique name serving as a key to store the address of the Last Blob.\r\n\r\n    During Eliza's runtime:\r\n    The Memory Manager continuously generates memories and periodically packages and uploads them.\r\n\r\n    For recovery:\r\n    With just the name, Eliza\u2019s TEE plugin can restore the same key, locate the Last Blob in the smart contract, and download the memory for self-recovery.\r\n    Not all memories need to be downloaded\u2014only the most recent ones suffice.\r\n\r\n4. Extension\r\n\r\n    We\u2019ve designed an extensible DA (Data Availability) adaptor that can cater to the agent\u2019s needs:\r\n\r\n    DA can be expensive, so memories can be uploaded to different platforms based on user preference:\r\n    * calldata of blockchain transaction\r\n    * celestia DA.\r\n    * other reliable storage solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n  -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n### After\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deployment, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--  Copy and paste command line output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--  Please specify deploy instructions if there is something more than the automated steps. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for the contributor role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->",

It successfully queried the app and showed the relevant response.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Add the new `@elizaos/plugin-asterai` plugin to an Eliza character\r\n2. Setup the ENV vars according to your asterai application. Instructions are in the new package's README.\r\n3. Ask the Eliza character a question that the asterai app can answer. For example, add the StockInfo plugin to the asterai app and test that Eliza can answer questions about stock prices by agent proxy.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\nThe package should be published on a repository like NPM so that users can consume the plugin easily.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nrellfy\r\n",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen more than 50-54 memory items are created within the same room ID, the `composeContext` function occasionally omits certain memories, leading to incomplete state data. This issue occurs when using the SQLite adapter. Note that I have not tested this with the other database adapters available, but I would be surprised if an SQLite database cannot handle more than 50 records within the memories table.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository:\r\n   ```\r\n   git clone git@github.com:Sifchain/sa-eliza.git\r\n   ```\r\n2. Checkout the branch `realitySpiral/testUsefulWorkflows` (based on the `develop` branch from the upstream eliza repository):\r\n   ```\r\n   git checkout realitySpiral/testUsefulWorkflows\r\n   ```\r\n3. Set the following `.env` variables:\r\n   ```\r\n   GITHUB_API_TOKEN=ghp_XXX\r\n\r\n   GITHUB_OWNER=sifchain\r\n   GITHUB_REPO=sa-eliza\r\n   GITHUB_BRANCH=sif-dev\r\n\r\n   GITHUB_ISSUES_LIMIT=100\r\n   GITHUB_PULL_REQUESTS_LIMIT=100\r\n   ```\r\n   Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/blob/realitySpiral/testUsefulWorkflows/docs/docs/packages/plugins.md#12-github-plugin-elizaplugin-github) for generating and using the GitHub API token.\r\n\r\n4. Install dependencies and start the agent:\r\n   ```\r\n   pnpm install -r\r\n   rm -rf agent/data && pnpm build && pnpm start --character=characters/staff-engineer.character.json\r\n   ```\r\n5. Observe the logs. At some point, you will notice the following:\r\n   ```\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Executing handler for action: INITIALIZE_REPOSITORY\"]\r\n\r\n   \u25ce LOGS\r\n     [initializeRepository] Composing state for message:\r\n     {\"id\":\"6a74eb9e-2eb1-00b7-bce3-a2d819d53bd5\",\"userId\":\"e0705f05-5af9-0ac4-80b9-a55815900197\",\"agentId\":\"b1ccf0ce-60b8-00ed-8da1-0fd7b791d233\",\"content\":{\"text\":\"No memories found, starting to initialize repository and create memories.\",\"action\":\"NOTHING\",\"source\":\"github\",\"inReplyTo\":\"3b2b2818-d716-08b7-a767-418a416a89c7\"},\"roomId\":\"a5e95f21-99e3-0354-add8-79108740b31a\",\"createdAt\":1736270012868}\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Initializing repository realityspiral/test on branch main...\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repository path: /tmp/elizaos-repos/realityspiral/test\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repos directory already exists: /tmp/elizaos-repos/realityspiral\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Cloning or pulling repository realityspiral/test... @ branch: main\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 URL: https://github.com/realityspiral/test.git @ branch: main\"]\r\n   ```\r\n   The repository information (`realityspiral/test`) is incorrect.\r\n\r\n6. Update the `.env` file to reduce memory storage limits:\r\n   ```\r\n   GITHUB_ISSUES_LIMIT=10\r\n   GITHUB_PULL_REQUESTS_LIMIT=10\r\n   ```\r\n7. Restart the agent:\r\n   ```\r\n   rm -rf agent/data && pnpm build && pnpm start --character=characters/staff-engineer.character.json\r\n   ```\r\n8. Observe the logs again. This time, the correct repository information is used:\r\n   ```\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Executing handler for action: INITIALIZE_REPOSITORY\"]\r\n\r\n   \u25ce LOGS\r\n     [initializeRepository] Composing state for message:\r\n     {\"id\":\"53d09a5a-289e-03d6-a49e-0fb655fe55c2\",\"userId\":\"41b1749c-25aa-0dc6-9cdf-cf3a1141fc55\",\"agentId\":\"b1ccf0ce-60b8-00ed-8da1-0fd7b791d233\",\"content\":{\"text\":\"No memories found, starting to initialize repository and create memories.\",\"action\":\"NOTHING\",\"source\":\"github\",\"inReplyTo\":\"3b2b2818-d716-08b7-a767-418a416a89c7\"},\"roomId\":\"a5e95f21-99e3-0354-add8-79108740b31a\",\"createdAt\":1736270165808}\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Initializing repository sifchain/sa-eliza on branch sif-dev...\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repository path: /tmp/elizaos-repos/sifchain/sa-eliza\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repos directory already exists: /tmp/elizaos-repos/sifchain\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Cloning or pulling repository sifchain/sa-eliza... @ branch: sif-dev\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 URL: https://github.com/sifchain/sa-eliza.git @ branch: sif-dev\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Checking out branch sif-dev in repository /tmp/elizaos-repos/sifchain/sa-eliza\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repository initialized successfully!

Additionally, the correct repository information should always be used.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- This issue appears to be tied to the SQLite adapter\u2019s handling of large memory sets.\r\n- Reducing the memory limits in the `.env` file mitigates the issue but does not resolve the underlying problem.\r\n- This behavior could impact other functionalities relying on the `composeContext` function if memory limits are exceeded.",
