Please describe.**\n\nWe currently lack a standardized structure in our packages, which can lead to confusion and inconsistent usage of testing and documentation practices.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a workflow that ensures each folder in `packages/` contains a `__tests__` folder for unit tests and a `README.md` file for documentation. This would help maintain consistency across packages and improve onboarding for new developers.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nImplementing manual checks, but this is prone to human error and may not be sustainable as the project scales.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nHaving a `__tests__` folder would encourage developers to write tests, and a `README.md` would provide essential information about the package's usage and functionality.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nNone at the moment.",

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, the system is limited to using TiktokenModel for token trimming, which restricts compatibility with non-OpenAI models. This limitation may hinder the integration of diverse models that could enhance performance and scalability.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a flexible token trimming mechanism that supports a variety of models beyond TiktokenModel. This could involve abstracting the token trimming logic to accommodate different model architectures and tokenization strategies.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nContinuing with the current model-specific approach, but this would limit the flexibility and potential for optimization across different models.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nExpanding support for non-OpenAI models will improve the system's adaptability and allow for better optimization of token trimming processes. This aligns with the goal of enhancing algorithm efficiency and scalability.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nNone at the moment, but tracking this enhancement will facilitate discussions around implementation strategies.",

        "body": "Investigation Summary:\r\n\r\n    PostgresDatabaseAdapter Initialization:\r\n        The PostgresDatabaseAdapter class in packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts is responsible for managing the PostgreSQL database connection and operations. It includes methods for initializing the database, handling errors, and executing queries.\r\n\r\n    Schema Initialization:\r\n        During the init method, the adapter checks if certain tables exist and attempts to initialize the schema by executing SQL scripts. This is where the extension setup might be happening.\r\n\r\n    Potential Issue:\r\n        If the vector extension is being created in the schema initialization process and it already exists, it would lead to the duplicate key error you're seeing.\r\n\r\nRecommended Steps:\r\n\r\n    Check Schema Files:\r\n        Review the schema.sql file in the adapter-postgres package to see if there are any CREATE EXTENSION commands for the vector extension. Ensure that these commands are wrapped in a conditional check to prevent re-creation if the extension already exists.\r\n\r\n    Modify Initialization Logic:\r\n        Update the initialization logic to check for the existence of the extension before attempting to create it. This can be done using a query like:\r\n\r\n        DO $$ BEGIN\r\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector') THEN\r\n                CREATE EXTENSION vector;\r\n            END IF;\r\n        END $$;\r\n\r\n    Database Cleanup:\r\n        As a temporary workaround, manually drop the vector extension from your database and let the initialization process recreate it. Use the following command in your PostgreSQL database:\r\n\r\n        DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS vector;\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "**Description**\r\nAdding a new type of “swarm agent” to the Eliza framework. The goal is to allow multiple agents to coordinate on tasks in a way similar to how single-character agents are currently configured, while supporting unique swarm features such as collective decision-making and interactions among multiple agents.\r\n\r\n**Motivation & Rationale**\r\n\r\nEliza currently supports single “character” agents with various providers, settings, and behaviours.\r\nA natural next step is to introduce the ability for multiple agents to work collectively (swarm) on tasks.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Feature Requirements**\r\n\r\n1. Swarm Agent Configuration\r\n\r\n_Support a dedicated configuration block for swarm agents in a manner similar to single-character agents._\r\n\r\n Allow specifying:\r\n- Number of agents in the swarm.\r\n- Provider definitions for each agent (could be the same or different).\r\n- Traditional settings (e.g., roles, personas, capabilities).\r\n- Additional swarm-specific settings (e.g., rules for agent coordination, speaker settings, collective decision-making thresholds).`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Create Swarm Logic.\r\n\r\n- Configure and Execute swarms by importing the core package in external projects.\r\n- Allow all supported clients to use swarm logic without disrupting current flows(ex: the last agent in a twitter maker team will post as a singular agent akin to current implementation).\r\n- Write dedicated test suite or carefully extend the current tests to confirm proper handling of the majority of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Document feature:\r\n\r\n- How multiple agents can be spawned and coordinated. \r\n- How tasks or sub-tasks are delegated among swarm agents (e.g., parallel vs. sequential).\r\n- How swarm memory storage works.\r\n- Document possible flows.\r\n- How can the utility be extended further. \r\n\r\n",

Write prompt to swap 1 eth with 1 bsc or any chain swap or bridge \r\n4.

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe project currently lacks Tagalog language support in its documentation. While there are translations for several other languages, Filipino developers cannot read the documentation in their native language. This is particularly important as it will improve accessibility and inclusivity for the growing tech community in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Tagalog translation of the main README.md as README_TG.md, including:\r\n- Full translation of all sections, including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines\r\n- Proper formatting to ensure readability\r\n- Addition of Tagalog (Tagalog) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\n- Maintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) – inadequate because automated translations may not accurately capture technical terms and nuances in Tagalog.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nTagalog is spoken by millions of Filipinos and is one of the primary languages in the Philippines.\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format).\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Filipino developer community.\r\n",

FerePro is an agent developed by [FereAI](https://www.fereai.xyz) which can perform open world Q&A related to various crypto topics like - Token Research, Investment Decisions, KOL research, category research, actions (swap, trade and more). It can interpret and answer questions of various complexities. We believe that adding this as a plugin will significantly improve Eliza's capabilities to perform research and Q&A.\r\n\r\n# Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA Plugin for FerePro in Eliza's codebase.\r\n\r\n# Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs an alternate, we will need to add a lot of tools and multi agentic capabilities to Eliza. FerePro can abstract all of that. \r\nDisclaimer: I'm a co founder and core dev at FereAI.\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n1. FerePro APIs can provide streaming answer as well as non streaming answer. This plugin must support both the use cases.\r\n2. FerePro APIs also provide a bunch of intermediate responses. This is usually shown in UI for users to get a view of happenings behind the scenes. They should only be enabled when this plugin is run in debug mode. Developers can use this info to troubleshoot or get support from Fere team.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n1. Developers will need to [get API keys from FereAI](https://docs.fereai.xyz/docs/api/api_access). \r\n3. This key must be passed to the plugin for it to work.\r\n4. FerePro is a freemium API. There is a limit on questions that can be asked for free. (We can revise the limits based on community feedback). For extended use cases, the developers must top up their account by visiting fereai.xyz.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAt [`Yotta Labs`](https://www.yottalabs.ai/), we are transforming global computing into a high-performance, decentralized AI platform. As part of this mission, I integrated the AI Agent functionality and selected the Eliza framework for managing agent-related tasks. \r\n\r\nWhile configuring the Twitter client and successfully logging into my account, I noticed an issue in the runtime logs: the message `[\"◎ Next tweet scheduled in 128 minutes\"]` appeared twice. This indicates that `generateNewTweetLoop` was called twice, resulting in two independent tweet scheduling loops being initialized.\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs because the `start` method in `/packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts` calls `generateNewTweetLoop` twice—once at line 174 and again at line 190—without any conditional checks to prevent multiple timers.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Add the following code to the relevant `character.json` file:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   \"clients\": [\"twitter\"]\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Configure the Twitter-related parameters in the `.env` file, and set `POST_IMMEDIATELY=true` to enable immediate tweet posting.\r\n\r\n3. Start the model service.\r\n\r\n4. Check Twitter, and you will find that two tweets are posted simultaneously. Additionally, the logs show the message `Next tweet scheduled in xxx minutes` printed twice.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe generateNewTweetLoop method should only be invoked once during the start method, ensuring that only a single tweet scheduling loop is active. This would prevent duplicate logs and redundant scheduling timers.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"833\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ebe87aa-ff46-488d-9961-90daf43b5aab\" />\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- File: /packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts\r\n- Method: start\r\n- Lines: 174 and 190\r\n- Observed Behavior: generateNewTweetLoop is called twice without a conditional check, causing two scheduling loops to be initialized.\r\n- Move second generateNewTweetLoop() inside the if (enableActionProcessing)",

    "body": "Title: Standardize boolean values and fix pattern for .env file\r\n\r\nDescribe the bug\r\nThe `.env` file contains some inconsistencies in how boolean values and specific strings are represented. For instance, the variable `POST_IMMEDIATELY` uses the string \"NO\", while a boolean value like `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE` uses `false`. This inconsistency could lead to parsing issues and is prone to human error. \r\n\r\nTo Reproduce\r\n1. Open the `.env` file. 2. Observe that `POST_IMMEDIATELY=NO` is used instead of the expected `false`. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n Boolean variables should consistently use `true` or `false`, and all string-based boolean values such as `POST_IMMEDIATELY` should use `true`/`false` instead of `\"YES\"`/`\"NO\"`. \r\n\r\nAdditional context\r\n This change will standardize boolean values, making the `.env` file easier to parse and reducing the risk of errors. The `parseBooleanFromText` function, declared as `const parseBooleanFromText: (text: string) => boolean;`, can be used outside the `.env` context to ensure boolean parsing is consistent across the codebase. \r\n\r\nGuidelines for .env values\r\n\r\n1. **Boolean values**: Always use `true` or `false` (not `\"YES\"` or `\"NO\"`). \r\nExample: ``` TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true POST_IMMEDIATELY=false ``` \r\n\r\n Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and make it easier for automated scripts to process the `.env` file while reduce  human error.",

    "title": "fix: Slack client Media type implementation missing required properties in message attachments",
    "body": "\r\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nTypeScript type error in Slack client when handling message attachments. The error occurs because the `attachments` property in the `Content` interface expects an array of `Media` type objects, but the code was only providing a subset of the required properties.\r\n\r\n**Error message:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nType '{ text: string; }[]' is not assignable to type 'Media[]'.\r\nType '{ text: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Media': id, url, title, source, description\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use the Slack client implementation.\r\n2. Try to create a message content with attachments.\r\n3. The code attempts to create an attachment with only the `text` property:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent ? [{ text: attachmentContent }] : undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe code should properly implement the `Media` type interface by providing all required properties:\r\n\r\n- `id` (string)\r\n- `url` (string)\r\n- `title` (string)\r\n- `source` (string)\r\n- `description` (string)\r\n- `text` (string)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nUpdate the attachment creation to include all required `Media` type properties:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent\r\n    ? [{\r\n        id: stringToUuid(`${event.ts}-attachment`),\r\n        url: '',  // Since this is text content, no URL is needed\r\n        title: 'Text Attachment',\r\n        source: 'slack',\r\n        description: 'Text content from Slack message',\r\n        text: attachmentContent\r\n    }]\r\n    : undefined,\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nThis issue affects the Slack client's message handling functionality in the `packages/client-slack/src/messages.ts` file. The fix ensures type safety while maintaining the intended functionality of handling text attachments from Slack messages.",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nManaging contributions in an open-source project can be challenging, especially when it comes to efficiently categorizing and prioritizing incoming pull requests. Manually labeling each pull request based on the files changed or branch names is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays in reviews and potential contributor frustration.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nImplementing an automated labeling system using GitHub Actions, specifically the `actions/labeler` action, would streamline this process. By configuring a `.github/labeler.yml` file, we can define rules that automatically apply labels to pull requests based on criteria such as modified file paths or branch naming conventions. This automation ensures consistent labeling, accelerates the triage process, and allows maintainers to focus on meaningful code reviews.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- **Manual Labeling**: Continuing to label pull requests by hand, which is inefficient and susceptible to human error.\r\n\r\n- **Custom Scripts**: Developing bespoke scripts to handle labeling, which would require additional maintenance and might not integrate seamlessly with GitHub's ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nAutomated labeling enhances the contributor experience by providing immediate feedback on the categorization of their pull requests. It also aids in project management by ensuring that all contributions are appropriately tagged, facilitating better tracking and prioritization. Implementing this feature aligns with best practices for open-source project maintenance, promoting efficiency and encouraging more streamlined collaboration.\r\n\r\nFor more information on setting up the labeler action, refer to the official GitHub documentation:  ",

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMaintaining an open-source project involves managing numerous issues and pull requests. Over time, some of these become inactive or outdated, cluttering the repository and making it challenging to identify current and relevant items. Manually tracking and closing such inactive issues and pull requests is time-consuming and prone to oversight.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nImplementing an automated workflow using the `actions/stale` GitHub Action can streamline this process. This action would automatically mark issues and pull requests as stale after a specified period of inactivity and subsequently close them if no further activity occurs. This automation ensures that the repository remains organized, with outdated or inactive items systematically managed.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- **Manual Management**: Regularly reviewing and closing inactive issues and pull requests by hand. However, this approach is labor-intensive and may lead to inconsistencies or delays in addressing stale items.\r\n\r\n- **Custom Scripts**: Developing bespoke scripts to handle stale issues and pull requests. While feasible, this requires additional maintenance and may not be as robust or feature-rich as existing solutions like `actions/stale`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe `actions/stale` GitHub Action is a widely used tool for managing inactive issues and pull requests. It allows for customization of inactivity periods, messages, and labels, providing flexibility to adapt to the project's specific needs. Implementing this action can improve project maintenance efficiency and enhance contributor engagement by clearly indicating which items require attention.\r\n\r\nFor more information and configuration options, refer to the official `actions/stale` documentation:\r\n\r\n ",

This leads to potential vulnerabilities being overlooked until later stages of development or after deployment, increasing the risk of security breaches and technical debt. A streamlined solution for continuous code scanning and vulnerability detection is needed.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**  \r\nIntegrate **CodeQL Analysis** into the GitHub repository for automated security scanning. CodeQL should:\r\n1. Analyze code for vulnerabilities across supported languages (C, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.).\r\n2. Run scans automatically on new commits and pull requests.\r\n3. Generate detailed reports highlighting security risks and offering actionable remediation steps.\r\n4. Integrate results directly into GitHub's Security tab for easy visibility and tracking.  \r\n\r\nThis integration will ensure continuous monitoring and improve overall code security and quality.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**  \r\n1. **Manual Code Reviews**: Time-intensive and prone to human error, making it an unreliable substitute for automated tools.  \r\n2. **Third-party Tools (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk)**: These provide similar features but may involve additional configuration, costs, or lack the seamless integration with GitHub that CodeQL offers.  \r\n3. **Custom Scripts**: Writing custom scripts for static code analysis, which is resource-intensive and lacks the depth and support of CodeQL.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**  \r\n- CodeQL is free for public repositories and deeply integrated into GitHub, making it an ideal choice for this workflow.  \r\n- Example use case: Pull requests are automatically scanned, and developers are alerted to vulnerabilities before merging.  \r\n- Relevant documentation for setup: [[CodeQL GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors).  \r\n\r\nPlease prioritize this integration to enhance the security and reliability of our codebase.",

The process involves manual screenshotting and posting, which is time-consuming and disrupts workflow efficiency.\r\n\r\nDescribe the solution you'd like\r\nI would like to see TradingView API integrated with the GOAT plugin to enable automatic or one-click sharing of annotated charts to Twitter. The solution should:\r\n\r\nFetch chart data, annotations, and other custom elements from TradingView via API.\r\nFormat the content appropriately for Twitter, including text captions for context and hashtags.\r\nProvide options to schedule or instantly post tweets from TradingView without switching between platforms.\r\nInclude settings for customization, such as default hashtags, watermarking charts, or adding predefined text templates.\r\nDescribe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nManual Process: Manually screenshotting charts and uploading them to Twitter, but this is inefficient and lacks automation.\r\nThird-party Tools: Using standalone apps like TweetDeck or social media managers, but these don't integrate with TradingView's annotations directly.\r\nCustom Scripts: Writing scripts to automate the TradingView-to-Twitter flow, but this requires significant development time and is not as user-friendly as a plugin-based solution.\r\nAdditional context\r\n\r\nTradingView provides an API that can retrieve chart data and render annotations, which can streamline integration.\r\nThe GOAT plugin already has a Twitter API integration, so extending its capabilities to include TradingView should be feasible.\r\nThis feature could significantly enhance the usability of both tools for traders and content creators.\r\nScreenshot or visual example of an ideal tweet with TradingView integration for reference:\r\n(Include a hypothetical example showing how a TradingView chart and description would appear in a tweet.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Fix Incorrect Fallback Logic for Image Model Provider API Keys",
    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAt _packages/core/src/generate.ts_ When the `imageModelProvider` did not match `modelProvider`, the code iteratively checked for API keys in a fallback chain. It stopped at the first available key (e.g., FAL_API_KEY), even if it belonged to the wrong provider. As a result, the selected API key could be incorrect (e.g., returning and using a key from FAL instead key from Venice).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Set imageModelProvider to VENICE in the character configuration.\r\n2. Provide both FAL_API_KEY and VENICE_API_KEY in .env(or any other relevant key combination).\r\n3. When requesting an image generation observe that the code selects FAL_API_KEY instead of VENICE_API_KEY.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf a specific imageModelProvider is set, the code should return the matching API key for that provider if it exists. If no specific provider key is found, the code should then try the fallback chain in sequence.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c086855-48b3-42ba-b410-6f87c2513711)\r\n\r\n**Fix** \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c59fae1b-652c-41e1-9540-fa2c2a85cba7)\r\n\r\n`const apiKey =\r\n    runtime.imageModelProvider === runtime.modelProvider\r\n        ? runtime.token\r\n        : (() => {\r\n            // First try to match the specific provider\r\n            switch (runtime.imageModelProvider) {\r\n                case ModelProviderName.HEURIST:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.TOGETHER:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.FAL:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.OPENAI:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.VENICE:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n                default:\r\n                    // If no specific match, try the fallback chain\r\n                    return (runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n            }\r\n        })();`\r\n\r\nThis fix updates the logic to first attempt to retrieve the API key from the specifically selected imageModelProvider. If that is not present, it will proceed down the fallback chain. This ensures that if an an image model api key is set, it is correctly chosen over other existing keys which are higher in the selection list, like FAL_API_KEY.\r\n\r\nPS: Solution is implemented and tested, creating bug report for tracked pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Docs: Add Discord token resolution guide to documentation  | Error [TokenInvalid]: An invalid token was provided",
    "body": "## Description\r\nWhile setting up Discord bots with multiple characters, I encountered and resolved an issue with Discord token resolution. This could be valuable documentation for other developers.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe Discord client was failing with the following error:\r\n```\r\nError [TokenInvalid]: An invalid token was provided.\r\n    at WebSocketManager.connect (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/websocket/WebSocketManager.js:136:26)\r\n    at Client.login (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/Client.js:228:21)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was happening even though the tokens were correctly set in the `.env` file. The issue was in how the tokens were being resolved from environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI fixed this by:\r\n\r\n1. Ensuring proper token resolution in `eliza/packages/client-discord/src/index.ts`:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Get the token using runtime's getSecret\r\nconst token = this.character?.settings?.secrets?.DISCORD_API_TOKEN;\r\n\r\n// If it's a variable reference (${...}), resolve it from environment\r\nif (token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}')) {\r\n    const envVarName = token.slice(2, -1);\r\n    this.apiToken = process.env[envVarName] || '';\r\n} else {\r\n    this.apiToken = token || '';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Adding debug logging to track token resolution:\r\n```typescript\r\nelizaLogger.debug('Token resolution debug:', {\r\n    characterName: this.character.name,\r\n    rawToken: token,\r\n    isEnvVar: token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}'),\r\n    envVarName: token?.startsWith('${') ? token.slice(2, -1) : null,\r\n    envValue: token?.startsWith('${') ? process.env[token.slice(2, -1)] : null\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Points\r\n1. Character files should reference environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"secrets\": {\r\n            \"DISCORD_API_TOKEN\": \"${DISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE}\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `.env` file should contain the actual tokens:\r\n```env\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE=actual_token_here\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JUAN=actual_token_here\r\n```\r\n(where Julie and Juan are agents names)\r\n\r\n3. The token resolution process:\r\n   - First checks character's settings.secrets\r\n   - If the value is a variable reference (${...}), resolves it from environment\r\n   - Otherwise uses the raw value\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTo verify the fix:\r\n1. Ensure tokens are correctly set in `.env`\r\n2. Run the bot with both characters:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --characters=\"characters/julie.character.json,characters/juan.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n3. Check debug logs for token resolution process \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI suggest:\r\n1. Adding this documentation to the main repository\r\n2. Possibly including it in the official docs under a \"Troubleshooting\" or \"Configuration\" section\r\n3. Adding debug logs to help other developers diagnose similar issues\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like me to create a PR with these changes. ",

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, our logging for the Coinbase plugin lacks structured formats and essential context, making it challenging to debug issues effectively and trace requests across services.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a structured logging framework that:\n- Uses JSON format for all logs.\n- Includes standard fields such as timestamp, severity, and correlation ID.\n- Supports context injection for better observability.\n- Has different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).\n- Allows adding custom fields relevant to the Coinbase plugin operations.\n\nFor example, using a logging framework like Winston in Node.js:\n```javascript\nconst logger = require('winston');\nlogger.info('User login attempt', { userId: '12345', correlationId: 'abc-123' });\n```\nThis will greatly assist in correlating events and debugging any issues that may arise.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Relying on plain text logs, which can be cumbersome to parse and analyze.\n- Using manual JSON formatting, which is error-prone.\n- Implementing APM tools without a standardized logging approach.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nEnhancing our logging practices will lead to better monitoring, easier log aggregation, and a more consistent logging pattern, ultimately improving our overall observability and debugging capabilities.",

    "title": "twitterShouldRespondTemplate Fails When Defined as a String in JSON Character Config",
    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen defining a `twitterShouldRespondTemplate` in a character’s JSON configuration file, the code attempts to invoke it as a function with `(validTargetUsersStr)`. Since JSON cannot store JavaScript functions, this causes runtime errors. Other templates like `twitterMessageHandlerTemplate` and `twitterPostTemplate` are handled purely as strings, so they work fine. The inconsistency leads to broken response generation when a JSON-defined `twitterShouldRespondTemplate` is present.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. **Create a character JSON file** (e.g., `adam.character.json`) that includes:\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"your-character-name\",\r\n        \"clients\": [\"telegram\", \"twitter\"],\r\n        \"modelProvider\": \"openai\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"secrets\": {\r\n                \"TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\": \"your_telegram_bot_token\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_USERNAME\": \"user\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_EMAIL\": \"email@proton.me\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_PASSWORD\": \"your_twitter_password\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_COOKIES\": \"[{\\\"key\\\":\\\"auth_token\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_auth_token\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"ct0\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_ct0_value\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"guest_id\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"v1%3A173451270913595996\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}]\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\": \"user1,user2\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        \"plugins\": [\r\n            \"@ai16z/plugin-your-custom-plugin\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"templates\": {\r\n            \"twitterPostTemplate\": \"# Areas of Expertise\\n{{knowledge}}\\n\\n# About {{agentName}} (@{{twitterUserName}}):\\n{{bio}}\\n{{lore}}\\n{{topics}}\\n\\n{{providers}}\\n\\n{{characterPostExamples}}\\n\\n{{postDirections}}\\n\\n# Task: Generate a post in the voice and style and perspective of {{agentName}} @{{twitterUserName}}.\\nWrite a 1-3 sentence post that is {{adjective}} about {{topic}} (without mentioning {{topic}} directly), from the perspective of {{agentName}}.
