There is a risk of potential issues if the frozen lock file is not respected, which could lead to inconsistent dependency versions across environments.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the installation commands across various files to ensure that the `pnpm install` command uses the `--frozen-lockfile` option. This prevents the lock file from being incorrectly updated during installations. Additionally, an explicit update script has been added to allow updates without the frozen lock file option. We updated the .npmrc default to set frozen-lockfile=true and in order to update the lockfile when you add a new dependency in your package.json or bump a version in your package.json you need to explicitly call pnpm i --no-frozen-lockfile \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Improvements**: This change improves the dependency management process by enforcing the use of a consistent lock file during installations.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

See this branch: [jure/fix-workflows-and-docs](https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/tree/jure/fix-workflows-and-docs). I even went so far to try to update Chinese etc. READMEs, which is of course complete nonsense since I don't even understand what is written there. Furthermore, there are scripts that use `pnpm install` that I cannot really test, and since it they are undocumented it's impossible to tell if they should be changed or not.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had a thought to update all references to `pnpm install`, but I changed my mind because it's not a black/white decision. People need to understand how lockfiles work, and if they are not using them properly it is not our ability (or responsibility) to educate them. The issues we're seeing today with lockfiles are the result of (1) `npm` / `pnpm`'s design decision (or rather, a change of), and (2) carelesness.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution therefore boils down to PR reviewers. In particular:\r\n- The `main` and `develop` branches should always be \"stable\", i.e. having passing tests\r\n- Whenever a PR introduces a change that causes tests to fail, it should not be merged until the cause of failure is established and corrected.\r\n\r\nThat said, the tests can fail for more than lockfile being out of sync, and we should probably focus on making them work in a reliable way. One of key issues is that our tests depend on external things such as OpenAI and API keys. I would recommend adding a separate smoke test just for OpenAI (a simple `curl` command)."

This behavior can cause unexpected issues when deploying or running the application, as the installed packages may not match the versions specified in the lock file.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository.\r\n2. Run the command `pnpm install` without the `--frozen-lockfile` option.\r\n3. Observe that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is updated with new versions of dependencies, even if they are not specified in the `package.json`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe `pnpm install` command should respect the `--frozen-lockfile` option, preventing any updates to the lock file. This ensures that the installed dependencies match the versions specified in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, maintaining consistency across different environments.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue was addressed in a recent commit that added the `--frozen-lockfile` option to various installation commands in the project, including in the GitHub workflows, Dockerfile, and scripts. The explicit update script was also introduced to allow updates without the frozen lock file option, ensuring that developers can manage dependencies more effectively without risking unintended changes to the lock file.",

            "body": "This is a draft PR for the V2 branch.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely work in progress.\r\n\r\nHere are the objectives of V2:\r\n\r\n* Unified message bus and simplified clients\r\nWe'll be refactoring all clients to handle input and output only, with an event bus to hook in response handlers.\r\nClients will have dramatically less code, and agents will be able to send messages across clients. This will also enable autonomous agent to unify all input and outputs into a single stream of thought and action.\r\n\r\n* Unified agent wallet\r\nThe current wallet system reflects the way we use humans use wallets today, but the UX around network switching and wallet management is a pain. Instead, the agent will have a unified wallet, with access to all registered chains at once. No wallet switching, and tokens will all be handled by agents in a unified way.\r\n\r\n* CLI Tool\r\nWe want a create-react-app like experience for creating new projects, and we want CLI handlers for adding and removing plugins, opening chat interface in browser, maybe even deploying like Cloudflare Wrangler to some of our deployment provider friends. Should also handle secrets management and character / agent / conversation management.\r\n\r\n* Model Provider Registry\r\nThe current model provider system requires a pull request to core for every model provider. v2 will have a registry and override pattern so new code doesn't need to be added to core, and any provider can quickly override with a few lines of code to add integration without a pull request.\r\n\r\n* Extensible and generic core framework\r\nThe v1 is very opinionated about prompts, state and some features. v2 will be very extensible so you can create different kinds of agents and override state management and context composition. For advanced developers, this will make the framework far more powerful and flexible for different user cases.\r\n\r\n* Community plugins\r\nWe'll be moving community plugins out of core and adding requirements for plugin inclusion in core around test coverage, documentation and code maintenance and ownership.\r\n\r\n* Better secret management\r\nCurrently, secret management in .env and character files is risky, so considering better and more secure options for this\r\n\r\n* 100% Test Coverage\r\nv2 reflects what we want Eliza to be, and we feel that after these changes we should focus entirely on stability, security and cutting down on issues. We'll be aiming for 100% test coverage of core, adapters and primary components, and end-to-end tests for clients.",

Fixed Chain Name Formatting:\r\n- Object generation sometimes returned the chain name without quotes, causing the transfer action to fail.\r\n- Improved this behavior by ensuring quotes are added in the constraint:\r\n```ts\r\nchains.map((item) => `\"${item}\"`).join(\"|\")\r\n```\r\n2. Added Linting Script:\r\n- Introduced a linting script to the project and fixed the linting errors.\r\n3. Restored Transfer Action Logic:\r\n- The merge of #965 degraded the transfer action by ignoring the buildTransferDetails() function.\r\n- This function has been reintegrated into the transfer action.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- Try initiate a transfer action with on the evm chain of your choice, the agent should correctly pick the chain.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes rely on automated tests.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou\r\n",

Added multichain support, the current version of the plugin only supported mainnet and Base, and there have been several requests for additional EVM chain support.\r\n\r\n- The plugin lacked test coverage, so we initiated tests alongside the feature development, starting with WalletProvider.\r\n- Refactored the plugin to make it more test-friendly and modular.\r\n- Added multichain support (for viem chains)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Improvements: Refactoring, cleaning, and testing of the existing plugin.\r\n- Fixes: fix transfer action\r\n- Features: Non-breaking changes to add EVM multichain support. The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup. No changes are required at this time.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## How was it tested\r\n\r\n- Ran test scripts \r\n- Verified functionality through agent interactions:\r\n<img width=\"709\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 5 58 35\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afde079e-7eaa-47cd-89df-60a93f895cd3\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nFile: packages/plugin-evm/src/tests/wallet.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nTry to add your own chain in the character and ask the agent to send some tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou",

No Way...But how?? The pkgs specifically lists `nodejs_23` and when I run `node version` I will see the `v23.2.0`, but that still does not equal `v20.18.1`.\r\n\r\nSo I did some digging bc Nix can be a pain in the ass at times with weird dependencies errors. So I checked the `pnpm` pkgs source code and found this line https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/394571358ce82dff7411395829aa6a3aad45b907/pkgs/development/tools/pnpm/generic.nix#L28\r\n\r\nAnd `nodejs` pkg points to:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e258b67-924e-4471-a590-d7bde3ac7c64)\r\n\r\nSo this here is the culprit for why a NixOS user will hit this weird error even though we declaratively chose the right node version."

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen trying to build a pnpm monorepo using Nix's buildNpmPackage that includes git dependencies (specifically @discordjs/opus), the build fails due to git access restrictions in the Nix build environment. The current workarounds involve either modifying package.json or pre-fetching git dependencies, both of which are not ideal solutions for maintaining the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA built-in way to handle git dependencies in buildNpmPackage that:\r\n\r\n 1. Automatically fetches git dependencies using fetchgit during the build process\r\n 2. Maintains compatibility with pnpm workspaces and monorepo structure\r\n 3. Preserves the original package.json without requiring modifications\r\n 4. Works with trusted dependencies in pnpm\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Manually pre-fetching git dependencies and placing them in node_modules\r\n2. Modifying package.json to use published versions instead of git dependencies\r\n3. Using mkDerivation instead of buildNpmPackage to handle the build process manually\r\n4. Creating a custom derivation to handle git dependencies before the main build\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue particularly affects projects using Discord.js and similar packages that rely on git dependencies for native modules. The current workarounds either break the development workflow or require maintaining separate package configurations for Nix builds.\r\nExample of a failing build: \r\n\r\n`ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH Cannot proceed with the frozen installation. The current \"overrides\" configuration doesn't match the value found in the lockfile`\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn the CONTRIBUTING.md file, there's some formatting issues in the branch naming section, :  \r\n\r\nIncorrect nested list numbering (using \"1.\" twice)   \r\nInconsistent formatting for the example (using \"eg.\" instead of \"Example:\")  \r\n\r\nThis inconsistency with our documentation style could lead to confusion and doesn't match the professional tone of the rest of the document.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n1. Use proper sequential numbering (1, 2)\r\n2. Replace \"eg.\" with \"Example:\" to match documentation style\r\n3. Use a more clear example number (9999)\r\n\r\nThe final format should look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.\r\n    \r\n    1. The name of the branch should start with the issue number and be descriptive of the changes you are making.  \r\n    2. Example: 9999--add-test-for-bug-123]\r\n ```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Keeping \"eg.\" but it's less formal than our documentation style\r\n2. Using different formatting like \"For example:\" or \"(example:)\" but \"Example:\" is cleaner\r\n4. Using a bullet point for the example, but numbered lists better show the relationship between the instruction and its example\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis change aligns with our documentation styleguide and makes the contribution guidelines more consistent and professional. It's a small change that improves readability and maintains our documentation standards.\r\n",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe project currently lacks Hebrew (RTL) language support in its documentation. While there are translations for several other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, etc.), Hebrew-speaking users cannot read the documentation in their native language. This is particularly important because Hebrew requires special RTL (Right-to-Left) formatting considerations.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Hebrew (RTL) translation of the main README.md as README_HE.md, including:  \r\n\r\n - Full translation of all sections including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines  \r\n - Proper RTL formatting using HTML/CSS directives\r\n - Addition of Hebrew (\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\nMaintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) - inadequate because it doesn't handle RTL formatting properly and translations are often inaccurate\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nHebrew is spoken by approximately 9 million people globally\r\n\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format)\r\n\r\nSpecial attention should be paid to RTL formatting using <div align=\"rtl\"> tags to ensure proper text direction\r\n\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Hebrew-speaking developer community",

These changes:\r\n- fix some existing issues with smoke and integration tests failing (esp. giving agent a fixed time to start that was not always sufficient)\r\n- extend integration test library with a full wrapper for setting up / tearing down a test\r\n- refactor existing integration test (\"Hello Trump\") to use new library\r\n- fix a potential issue with possible leak of API keys (not related to integration tests themselves)\r\n- remove a dependency that was previously added but is no longer required\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovement + bug fix + feature\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis is to improve overall project quality via better testing..\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNone\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nTo test the tests, these changes need to be run in CI workflow.\r\nIf either smoke or integration tests fail, the PR should NOT be merged.

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/1014\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nWhen the proposed tests are configured to run in CI/CD environment, they need one or more API keys which are considered as secrets. It is necessary to ensure that they are not leaked through workflows being run on behalf of malicious pull requests. In addition to restrictions on running CI/CD workflows we recommend setting up a quota on those keys, and rotating them periodically.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n1. This PR adds two basic tests:\r\n- smoke tests: checks that the project can be built and run\r\n- \"Hello Trump\": checks that the project can use one of the built-in characters (Trump) to successfully query a LLM (OpenAI).\r\n\r\nThe \"Hello Trump\" test requires OpenAI API keys to run. If the API keys are not available, this test will be skipped.\r\n\r\n2. This PR also adds initial (proof of concept) version of integration testing framework. We plan to continue development of this framework in the future as will be adding more integration tests.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThe goal of these tests is to establish a quality gate that every PR should pass at a minimum. We recommend that the tests are run at least:\r\n- on every PR before merging it\r\n- every time the main/stable branch is updated\r\n\r\nAs a policy, merges to main/stable branch should not be allowed if they would break the tests.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nThe included file `tests/README.md` describes the procedure how to set the tests up in a CI/CD environment. The API keys should be set up the repository settings under \"secrets\". When present, they will automatically be added to the .env file for the duration of the workflow.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nThis PR adds a workflow file `integrationTests.yaml` with two jobs. The reviewer should:\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3. Check output of jobs for any errors.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3. Check output of jobs for any errors.\r\n4. Adjust workflow rules to trigger workflows as desired (on pull request, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nuser98634\r\n",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, maintaining comprehensive JSDoc documentation across our TypeScript codebase is a manual and time-consuming process. This leads to inconsistent documentation coverage and puts an unnecessary burden on developers. We need an automated solution that can help generate and maintain JSDoc comments while ensuring high quality and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nPropose a two-phase approach:\r\n\r\n1. Manual Documentation Phase:\r\n   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript files\r\n   - Include documentation for functions, classes, interfaces, and other code blocks\r\n\r\n2. Automation Implementation:\r\n   - Develop an LLM-based automation solution for generating JSDoc comments\r\n   - Integrate the automation into our CI/CD pipeline (like when a PR for a new feat is merged)\r\n   - Create a manual trigger mechanism for the automation process\r\n\r\n**Create a GitHub Actions workflow/AI agent that:**\r\n\r\n1. Automated Documentation Generation:\r\n   - Triggers on demand (via workflow_dispatch) or when specific files change\r\n   - Scans TypeScript files that lack JSDoc documentation\r\n   - Uses an AI service (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate contextually accurate JSDoc comments\r\n   - Maintains existing JSDoc comments and only adds missing ones\r\n\r\n2. Quality Control:\r\n   - Follows our existing JSDoc standards and TypeDoc configuration\r\n   - Validates generated comments for completeness and accuracy\r\n   - Ensures proper documentation of parameters, return types, and function descriptions\r\n\r\n3. Pull Request Management:\r\n   - Creates a new branch for documentation updates\r\n   - Generates a pull request with the changes\r\n   - Adds appropriate labels (e.g., 'documentation', 'automated')\r\n   - Includes a detailed PR description explaining the changes\r\n   - Assigns relevant reviewers\r\n\r\n4. Configuration:\r\n   - Allows customization of AI prompt templates\r\n   - Provides options to include/exclude specific files or directories\r\n   - Configurable commit message and PR templates\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Manual documentation enforcement through PR checks\r\n2. Using existing JSDoc generation tools like https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc\r\n3. Implementing stricter code review policies for documentation\r\n4. Creating documentation sprints for batch updates\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRequired Permissions and Secrets:\r\n- GitHub token with PR creation permissions\r\n- AI service API key (e.g., OpenAI)\r\n- Repository write access for branch creation\r\n\r\n### Additional Motivation\r\n\r\nThis could be a proof of concept AI junior dev Karpathy talks about\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c3c68f-d85a-414c-a26f-231bd6ecb831)\r\n\r\n",

Run the smoke tests: `pnpm run smokeTests`\r\n2. Verify that version information is displayed at start\r\n3. Verify that the script properly handles timeouts\r\n4. Verify that process cleanup occurs on both success and failure\r\n5.

This is a best practice as coverage reports are generated artifacts that should not be version controlled.\r\n\r\nUpdated the CI\u202fworkflow to generate coverage files to upload to codecov.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nCheck the `.gitignore` file to verify the coverage directory has been added correctly.\r\n\r\nCheck the ci workflow file to see the coverage files generation.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Run tests with coverage enabled (`TEST_COVERAGE=1 pnpm test`)\r\n2. Verify that the generated coverage directory is not tracked by git\r\n3. Run `git status` to confirm the coverage directory is ignored\r\n",

If documentation references the Twitter search or model providers, a brief note should be added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review `packages/client-twitter/src/index.ts` and `packages/client-twitter/src/search.ts` to see changes in the Twitter search logic.\r\n- Review `packages/core/src/models.ts` to confirm the addition of the image model for the Galadriel provider.\r\n- Check `docs/docs/guides` and `docs/quickstart.md` for any changes that may need follow-up documentation edits.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Pull down the changes locally.\r\n2. Run the application with the updated code.\r\n3. Verify that the Twitter client no longer starts the search client by default (reducing rate limit concerns).\r\n4. Confirm that the Galadriel image model is listed and accessible as expected.\r\n5. Review logs and behavior to ensure no errors are introduced by the changes.\r\n\r\nNo special UI changes, so no screenshots required.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nDiscord username: `vi0000`\r\n",

Configure Twitter credentials in .env\r\n2. Initialize client:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst client = new TwitterPostClient(baseClient, runtime);\r\nawait client.start();\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Verify tweet generation:\r\n- Check logs for \"Generating new tweet\"\r\n- Confirm tweet appears on Twitter\r\n- Verify proper truncation to 240 chars\r\n5. Test action processing:\r\n- Check logs for \"Processing tweet actions\"\r\n- Verify likes/retweets/quotes/replies execute\r\n- Confirm rate limiting works\r\n6. Verify error handling:\r\n- Test with invalid credentials\r\n- Check error logging\r\n- Confirm graceful failure\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\nRequires the following environment variables:\r\n\r\n```\r\nACTION_INTERVAL\r\nENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\ndorianjanezic\r\n",

This usually costs money, however there exists a free option today: chatapi.akash.network. This is an openAI api compatible api that runs standard LLMs like llama3.1-405B and llama3.3-70B for free! \r\n\r\nThe official announcement of the public release: https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1814018478845616362 \r\nYou can get your api key here: https://chatapi.akash.network\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a new model provider to the list of model providers\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nIm a big fan of the work of akash.network and I've been using this service myself for a while now. Its great to have access to bigger models for testing without risking huge token spends on your personal creditcard\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. The env variables are added in the .env.example including the relevant links to where to get the key and how it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nI tested it by following the steps below and got the following result:\r\n<img width=\"391\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-16 at 3 35 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e89c34-e8f5-47c3-9ffa-130152d65227\" />\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nFollow the test steps below (should be really easy!)\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nEasiest way to test is to do the following:\r\n1. clone repo\r\n2. Go to https://chatapi.akash.network and request a new api key (no email required, optional)\r\n3. run `cp .env.example .env` in the root and set the api key here\r\nhttps://github.com/MbBrainz/eliza/blob/de87bfaa308091ff14ff488f5a446cf72b8904c4/.env.example#L234C1-L238C73 \r\n4. change the model provider in  `./packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` to `modelProvider: ModelProviderName.AKASH_CHAT_API,`\r\n5. run `pnpm build & pnpm start`\r\n6. send a msg and verify if the model is akash_chat_api and if it responds\r\n7 \u2705\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nMbBrainz\r\n",

Any context or related work?\r\nThis client allows agents to post to Lens, a social graph that is permissionless and provides a more onchain environment for agents, with a variety of monetization options including collectable posts and open actions.\r\n\r\nThis client is similar to the latest Farcaster client and serves as a base for other devs to include more Lens functionality.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nA few `.env` variables are needed \r\n- get an evm wallet private key\r\n- get a lens profile owned by the same wallet: https://onboarding.lens.xyz/mint\r\n- get ipfs api credentials: https://storj.dev/dcs/api/storj-ipfs-pinning\r\n\r\n```\r\n# client-lens\r\nEVM_PRIVATE_KEY=\r\nLENS_PROFILE_ID=\r\nSTORJ_API_USERNAME=\r\nSTORJ_API_PASSWORD=\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `defaultCharacter.ts` - add the new client to the `clients` array\r\n```\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [],\r\n    clients: [Clients.LENS],\r\n    modelProvider: ModelProviderName.GROK,\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. set new `.env` variables\r\n2. add client to character file\r\n3. start the server\r\n4. agent fetches timeline to generate a new post, and fetches mentions to generate comments\r\n5. if agent creates a post, check it at `https://hey.xyz/u/{agentHandle}`\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n`imthatcarlos`\r\n",

This PR addresses this gap.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added complete prebuild source refactored files\r\n- Maintained file structure as per repository\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified plugin continues to function as expected\r\n- Confirmed build process completes successfully with prebuild files\r\n- No regression in existing functionality\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- This is a maintenance PR to ensure we have complete source control and can properly debug/maintain the plugin\r\n- No functional changes, purely adding source files that should have been included initially\r\n- Follows original plugin structure",

This PR implements a plugin for agents to be able to interact with Cronos ZKEVM.\r\n\r\nIn this first version, only the transfer function is supported. Further work will extend this functionality.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nWe're seeing a huge proliferation of AI agents being able to manage value on-chain. This is similar conceptually to these plugins (e.g. plugin-solana and others)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis plugin follows the standards set by other crypto integrations, including things like the SEND_TOKENS action. Changes to the overall project documentation don't seem to be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are in plugin-cronoszkevm\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIn .env you should set the value for CRONOSZKEVM_ADDRESS (this is the public address for the agent account) and CRONOSZKEVM_PRIVATE_KEY (private key for the same account).\r\nTo test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) can be used to send ZKCRO directly to an address on Cronos zkEVM\r\n\r\nRun the agent and prompt it with: \"send 0.5 ZKCRO to \" - e.g. \"send 1 ZKCRO to 0xee0c40F86544a8b0616BC827728f714a8B4cEeE7\"\r\n\r\nAssuming you had 1 ZKCRP to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. Transfer completed successfully! \"tx: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Cronos zkEVM explorer (https://explorer.zkevm.cronos.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

Built to support twitter for now.\r\n\r\nLeverages Privy as the account repository and Privy import feature to add users social account. This creates a wallet on behalf of the user that they can claim by logging in with twitter on that Privy instance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the data source could be replaced with an onchain social registry that anyone can opt into themselves to link their socials to a wallet, using TEE-verified oauth. With a reserve vault smart contract layer on top of that, this could hold tokens sent to users that haven't signed up yet and then easily be claimed on signup.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nTo enable agents to send tokens directly to twitter handles without having to know the users wallet address. This could spark entirely new forms of meta games, stories, and economies.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61408862-0a18-4e8e-a656-914dc83f8ee0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ff281c-a152-4f57-8af7-77296e764009)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9b75c4-f29c-4c7f-8f70-70e44770afb4)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`/packages/plugin-social-wallets`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nAdd env values for:\r\n- PRIVY_APP_ID\r\n- PRIVY_APP_SECRET\r\n- EVM_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n- TWITTER_USERNAME\r\n- TWITTER_PASSWORD\r\n- TWITTER_EMAIL\r\n\r\nRun `sh ./scripts/start.sh`\r\nAsk agent `send 0.001 ETH to @<twitter_username>`\r\n\r\nIn addition some adjustments may need to be made to plugin-evm that triggers the TX flow. Last time we tested, that plugin was giving us some issues and we had to resolve them to get the plugin to trigger.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@djdabs_\r\n",

Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache\n2. npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces\n3. installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation)\n\nThis can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B\n\nUsers generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it).\n\nHere, that expectation is broken\n\n### Details\n\nSee PoC.\n\nIn it, overrides from a single run of A get leaked into e.g. `~/Library/Caches/pnpm/metadata/registry.npmjs.org/rimraf.json` and persistently affect all other projects using the cache\n\n### PoC\n\nPostinstall code used in PoC is benign and can be inspected in <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ponyhooves?activeTab=code>, it's just a `console.log`\n\n1. Remove store and cache\n   On mac: `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/pnpm ~/Library/pnpm/store`\n   This step is not required in general, but we'll be using a popular package for PoC that's likely cached\n2. Create `A/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"A\",\n     \"pnpm\": { \"overrides\": { \"rimraf>glob\": \"npm:ponyhooves@1\" } },\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i --ignore-scripts` (the flag is not required, but the point of the demo is to show that it doesn't help)\n4. Create `B/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"B\",\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i`\n\nResult:\n```console\nPackages: +3\n+++\nProgress: resolved 3, reused 3, downloaded 0, added 3, done\nnode_modules/.pnpm/ponyhooves@1.0.1/node_modules/ponyhooves: Running postinstall script, done in 51ms\n\ndependencies:\n+ rimraf 6.0.1\n\nDone in 1.4s\n```\n\nAlso, that code got leaked into another project and it's lockfile now! \n\n### Impact\n\nGlobal state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs\n\nAs a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pnpm/pnpm

for `pnpm pack --json` to print packed tarball and contents in JSON format [#&#8203;8765](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8765).\n\n#### Patch Changes\n\n-   `pnpm exec` should print a meaningful error message when no command is provided [#&#8203;8752](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8752).\n-   `pnpm setup` should remove the CLI from the target location before moving the new binary [#&#8203;8173](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8173).\n-   Fix `ERR_PNPM_TARBALL_EXTRACT` error while installing a dependency from GitHub having a slash in branch name [#&#8203;7697](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/7697).\n-   Don't crash if the `use-node-version` setting is used and the system has no Node.js installed [#&#8203;8769](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8769).\n-   Convert settings in local `.npmrc` files to their correct types. For instance, `child-concurrency` should be a number, not a string [#&#8203;5075](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/5075).\n-   pnpm should fail if a project requires a different package manager even if `manage-package-manager-versions` is set to `true`.\n-   `pnpm init` should respect the `--dir` option [#&#8203;8768](https://redirect.github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8768).\n\n#### Platinum
