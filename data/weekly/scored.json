Which on subsequent messages, would trigger the callback to respond to the same message multiple times.\r\n\r\nWhere the continue action is meant for a natural flow of thoughts to keep generating, on normal back and forth convo's it would duplicate response.\r\n\r\nFix below now stops that as it takes into consideration its own message it just responded to, and how it framed to either not respond again, or continue a thought as it was intended.\r\n\r\n---TESTING Screen Record---\r\n1st section shows a previous double response, which is triggered by the question the agent asked to the user, which in turn triggers a double response on the next reply from the user\r\n\r\n2nd section shows continue being triggered as normal, but not triggering another response in the handler callback since it already responded. This will still allow continue to allow the agent to \"continue\" a thought it had as it was intended, also, per the examples.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ed92c8f-dc99-4c3b-95fc-9c0052f56197\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nninja_dev\r\n",

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, the system is limited to using TiktokenModel for token trimming, which restricts compatibility with non-OpenAI models. This limitation may hinder the integration of diverse models that could enhance performance and scalability.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a flexible token trimming mechanism that supports a variety of models beyond TiktokenModel. This could involve abstracting the token trimming logic to accommodate different model architectures and tokenization strategies.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nContinuing with the current model-specific approach, but this would limit the flexibility and potential for optimization across different models.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nExpanding support for non-OpenAI models will improve the system's adaptability and allow for better optimization of token trimming processes. This aligns with the goal of enhancing algorithm efficiency and scalability.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nNone at the moment, but tracking this enhancement will facilitate discussions around implementation strategies.",

Please describe.**\r\nour current implementation lacks support for azure's suite of models, which limits our ability to fully utilize their ecosystem. this creates challenges when integrating with organizations heavily invested in azure for their infrastructure and services. without support for azure models, we're unable to offer flexibility to teams looking to standardize their ai deployments within azure environments.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd support for all azure models across our platform. this includes providing seamless integration for model hosting, training, and inferencing via azure's api and tools. users should be able to deploy and manage models using azure's ecosystem with the same ease and functionality offered for other supported providers.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nrelying on third-party middleware or custom solutions to bridge the gap between our platform and azure's services. however, these are often cumbersome and introduce maintenance overhead.\r\ncontinuing to use existing supported providers exclusively, but this limits our ability to work with azure-focused organizations and may push potential users away.\r\ndeveloping an entirely separate module for azure models, though this could lead to fragmentation in our feature set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nazure is one of the leading cloud platforms, with a growing presence in the ai and ml space. support for azure models would unlock access to their advanced tools like azure machine learning, cognitive services, and integration with microsoft products. this would make our platform more appealing to enterprise customers already using azure for their cloud infrastructure. this could start out as just support for openai in azure but you can imagine how powerful the azure apis could be for using [all of the supported models](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)",

The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the integration of the `fereai-provider` in the `package.json` and the configuration of the required environment variables. Then, examine the updates made to `packages/core/src/generation.ts`, `packages/core/src/models.ts`, `packages/core/src/types.ts` and the `agent/src/index.ts` handlers under API configurations to understand the response handling.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables**:  \r\n   - Ensure that `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` are correctly set in the environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Run `pnpm add` to install the new `fereai-provider` module.\r\n\r\n3. **Run Unit Tests**:  \r\n   - Execute the `fereai-provider` test suite to verify that all existing and new tests pass successfully.\r\n   - For `fereai-provider` tests, refer to the [fereai-provider tests](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider/blob/main/packages/fereai/src/fereai.test.ts).\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing**:  \r\n   - Interact with the chatbot to ensure that responses are handled correctly and that the integration with FereAI APIs functions as expected using `fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Monitor logs to confirm that structured logging is operational and that no errors related to the new integration occur.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

The goal is to allow multiple agents to coordinate on tasks in a way similar to how single-character agents are currently configured, while supporting unique swarm features such as collective decision-making and interactions among multiple agents.\r\n\r\n**Motivation & Rationale**\r\n\r\nEliza currently supports single \u201ccharacter\u201d agents with various providers, settings, and behaviours.\r\nA natural next step is to introduce the ability for multiple agents to work collectively (swarm) on tasks.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Feature Requirements**\r\n\r\n1. Swarm Agent Configuration\r\n\r\n_Support a dedicated configuration block for swarm agents in a manner similar to single-character agents._\r\n\r\n Allow specifying:\r\n- Number of agents in the swarm.\r\n- Provider definitions for each agent (could be the same or different).\r\n- Traditional settings (e.g., roles, personas, capabilities).\r\n- Additional swarm-specific settings (e.g., rules for agent coordination, speaker settings, collective decision-making thresholds).`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Create Swarm Logic.\r\n\r\n- Configure and Execute swarms by importing the core package in external projects.\r\n- Allow all supported clients to use swarm logic without disrupting current flows(ex: the last agent in a twitter maker team will post as a singular agent akin to current implementation).\r\n- Write dedicated test suite or carefully extend the current tests to confirm proper handling of the majority of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Document feature:\r\n\r\n- How multiple agents can be spawned and coordinated. \r\n- How tasks or sub-tasks are delegated among swarm agents (e.g., parallel vs. sequential).\r\n- How swarm memory storage works.\r\n- Document possible flows.\r\n- How can the utility be extended further. \r\n\r\n",

I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.  I know there is alot of interest in the memory system as well so as part of the core it should be as clear as possible IMHO."

            "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, we observed issues with aixbt, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Reclaim as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Reclaim is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nUpdates \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating **Reclaim** as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zero-knowledge proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-reclaim README.\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Proof Verification Example\r\nBelow is a screenshot showcasing the generated proof and its verification process:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 39 17\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c64b01-47b1-4ece-8624-9b65e7624f66\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 31 20\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41d675e-9249-4c46-9f12-396f02b7d8b2\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure the following environment variables (generated from the [Reclaim Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)):\r\n```\r\n# Reclaim Protocol\r\nRECLAIM_APP_ID= # Reclaim App ID\r\nRECLAIM_APP_SECRET= # Reclaim App Secret\r\n\r\n# Verifiable Inference Configuration\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_ENABLED=true # Set to true to enable verifiable inference\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=reclaim # Options: reclaim, opacity (soon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run a character using the command:\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"`\r\n\r\n3. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n4. Interact with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- Automated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n- No database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n--> Gajesh#0000\r\n",

After applying this fix, the query execution time dropped to just **0.02 seconds**. This improvement was observed using Supabase analytics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Changes to existing functionality to improve database query performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts` to understand how sorting and limiting were implemented in the database query.\r\n- Look at the adjusted runtime logic in `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` for the integration of the `limit` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1.

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8. Please let me know if anything is broke when you test it, it worked well on my end.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

            "body": "# feat: Twitter Spaces Integration\r\n\r\n**Discord**: `slkz.`\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces integration of **Twitter Spaces** into the AI agent, providing:\r\n- **Automatic** Space launch decisions (random chance, business hours, cooldown intervals, etc.).\r\n- **Multi-speaker** handling (configurable `maxSpeakers`).\r\n- **Speaker queue** management for overflow.\r\n- **GPT-based filler** messages (welcome, idle, closing, etc.).\r\n- Optional **plugins**: Idle monitor, TTS bridging (STT/TTS), and local audio recording.\r\n\r\nNo breaking changes are introduced beyond **adding** this new functionality and **updating** the `agent-twitter-client` to support advanced speaker logic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Flow Recap\r\n\r\n1. **Periodic Check**  \r\n   We call `startPeriodicSpaceCheck()`, typically with a dynamic interval.  \r\n   - **When no Space is running**: we do `shouldLaunchSpace()`, which decides whether to launch based on random chance, business hours, and a minimum cooldown.  \r\n   - **When a Space is running**: we call `manageCurrentSpace()` more frequently (e.g. every 20 seconds) to handle speaker timeouts, queue acceptance, occupancy changes, and potential stop conditions.\r\n\r\n2. **Space Creation**  \r\n   - We generate a `SpaceConfig` from either pre-set `charSpaces.topics` or GPT (if none are provided).  \r\n   - We instantiate a new `Space`, conditionally add:\r\n     - **RecordToDiskPlugin** (audio recording to disk).\r\n     - **SttTtsPlugin** (speech-to-text and text-to-speech bridging).\r\n     - **IdleMonitorPlugin** (idle detection).  \r\n   - We hook into events: `speakerRequest`, `occupancyUpdate`, `idleTimeout`, etc.\r\n\r\n3. **Speaker Logic**  \r\n   - We maintain an **array** of `activeSpeakers` and a **queue** for overflow if `activeSpeakers.length` hits `maxSpeakers`.  \r\n   - Each speaker is subject to `speakerMaxDurationMs`; upon exceeding it, we remove them (optionally speaking a filler message).  \r\n   - If a speaker is removed and the queue is **non-empty**, we accept the next queued request.  \r\n   - If more than `maxSpeakers` are active for any reason, we remove extras.\r\n\r\n4. **Stopping**  \r\n   - `stopSpace()` finalizes the Space, logs the time of completion (`lastSpaceEndedAt`), clears states, and sets `isSpaceRunning = false`.  \r\n   - The system then reverts to checking at a slower interval until we decide to launch a new Space again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### A) `.env` / Environment Variables\r\n\r\nIf you want to store GPT or ElevenLabs tokens:\r\n```bash\r\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\r\nELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...\r\n```\r\n### B) `character.json` \u2192 `\"twitterSpaces\"` Field\r\n\r\nBelow is an **example** JSON snippet for the `twitterSpaces` object in `character.json`:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n  \"twitterSpaces\": {\r\n    // Maximum simultaneous speakers (1 = single speaker, 2+ = multi)\r\n    \"maxSpeakers\": 2,\r\n\r\n    // Array of predefined topic strings\r\n    // If empty, we use GPT to generate some\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"Blockchain Trends\",\r\n      \"AI Innovations\"\r\n    ],\r\n\r\n    // Max overall duration (in minutes) for the Space\r\n    \"typicalDurationMinutes\": 45,\r\n\r\n    // Idle threshold in ms (e.g., 300000 = 5 minutes)\r\n    \"idleKickTimeoutMs\": 300000,\r\n\r\n    // Minimum interval (minutes) before launching another Space\r\n    \"minIntervalBetweenSpacesMinutes\": 60,\r\n\r\n    // If true, only launch between 9:00-17:00 UTC\r\n    \"businessHoursOnly\": true,\r\n\r\n    // Probability (0.0 - 1.0) at each check\r\n    \"randomChance\": 0.3,\r\n\r\n    // Flags to enable or disable specific plugins\r\n    \"enableIdleMonitor\": true,\r\n    \"enableSttTts\": true,\r\n    \"enableRecording\": false,\r\n\r\n    // TTS / GPT config (e.g., for ElevenLabs)\r\n    \"voiceId\": \"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\",\r\n    \"sttLanguage\": \"en\",\r\n    \"gptModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\r\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful AI co-host assistant.\",\r\n\r\n    // Max speaking time (ms) for each speaker\r\n    \"speakerMaxDurationMs\": 240000\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key Fields**:\r\n- **`maxSpeakers`**: 1 for single-speaker style, or higher to allow multiple.  \r\n- **`topics`**: if empty, GPT auto-generates.  \r\n- **`idleKickTimeoutMs`**: triggers `idleTimeout` if no audio detected for that duration.  \r\n- **`randomChance`**: probability for each check to spawn a Space.  \r\n- **`speakerMaxDurationMs`**: automatically remove a speaker after this many ms.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Potential Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Audio Message Queue**: Manage TTS outputs in a queue to avoid overlapping messages.  \r\n- **Knowledge Storage**: Gather insights from Space interactions and store them as knowledge or memory afterwards.  \r\n- **Speaker-less Spaces**: Optionally launch Spaces without external speakers, functioning as \u201cTED talk\u201d monologues or scheduled broadcasts.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- This is our **first** official integration of Twitter Spaces, not an upgrade from a previous version.  \r\n- **No Breaking Changes** expected outside the new `agent-twitter-client` version.  \r\n- For questions, you can reach me on Discord: `slkz.`\r\n\r\nThank you!",

The only integration point is through the plugin system which is designed for extensibility.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a new Hummingbot plugin that enables Eliza agents to perform automated market making and trading operations. The plugin provides:\r\n- Real-time market data streaming via WebSocket\r\n- Simple market making strategy with configurable parameters\r\n- Order lifecycle management (create, cancel, track)\r\n- Inventory skew management\r\n- Type-safe configuration and error handling\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation as the plugin includes its own comprehensive README.md with installation, configuration, and usage instructions.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the plugin's architecture in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/index.ts`\r\n2. Check the market making strategy implementation in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/strategies/simple-market-making.ts`\r\n3. Review type definitions and configuration interface in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/types.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`\r\n2. Configure Hummingbot instance details in your character config:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"plugins\": [\"@eliza/plugin-hummingbot\"],\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"HUMMINGBOT_CONFIG\": {\r\n      \"instance\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"http://localhost:15888\",\r\n        \"apiKey\": \"your-api-key\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}",

            "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",
