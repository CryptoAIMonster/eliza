Key updates include:  \r\n1. Parsing `transferTemplate` details to dynamically construct transactions for processing.  \r\n2. Validating input parameters (e.g., `receivingAddresses`, `network`) to ensure they comply with supported formats and networks.  \r\n3. Appending all processed transactions (successes and failures) to a CSV file dynamically created in `src/plugins/transactions.csv`.  \r\n4. Generating wallet details dynamically if not already present.  \r\n5. If a wallet is not pre-configured:\r\n   - A new wallet is generated and saved to `characters/charactername.character.json` under `settings.secrets`.\r\n   - If the character file does not exist, the wallet details are saved to a `character-seed.txt` file, and a note is added to move these details manually to the character's settings or environment variables.  \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Improvements:** Adds dynamic appending and parsing of CSV data.  \r\n**Features:** Introduces mass payouts using Coinbase SDK for supported networks.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n**Yes.** The changes require an update to project documentation to reflect:  \r\n1. New `transferTemplate` structure for mass payouts.  \r\n2. Supported networks (`base`, `sol`, `eth`, `arb`, `pol`).  \r\n3. Steps to validate environment variables for `COINBASE_API_KEY` and `COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`.  \r\n4. Guidance for handling dynamically generated wallets (e.g., adding details from `character-seed.txt` to `settings.secrets` or `.env`).  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. `massPayoutProvider.get` function for dynamic parsing and handling of CSV records.  \r\n2. `executeMassPayout` logic for sequential processing of transactions.  \r\n3. Integration of Coinbase SDK for wallet initialization and balance checks.  \r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables:**  \r\n   - Ensure `COINBASE_API_KEY` and `COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` are set in the `.env` file or runtime settings.  \r\n\r\n2. **Process Mass Payout Transactions:**  \r\n   - Execute a payout request using the `SEND_MASS_PAYOUT` action.  \r\n   - Validate successful transactions are logged in the CSV file.  \r\n\r\n3. **Wallet Generation:**  \r\n   - Remove `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_HEX_SEED` and `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_ID` from your configuration.  \r\n   - Verify that a new wallet is created and stored in `characters/charactername.character.json` under `settings.secrets`.  \r\n   - If the character file does not exist, confirm that the wallet details are written to `charactername-seed.txt` with instructions to move them manually.  \r\n\r\n4. **Validate Edge Cases:**  \r\n   - Process invalid addresses.  \r\n   - Handle insufficient wallet balances.  \r\n   - Verify proper CSV appending and transaction updates.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/160rreXAoKBj9db8lIMjF5LW8EmAihQmi/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### After  \r\n- Dynamic CSV appending:  \r\n```csv\r\nAddress,Amount,Status,Error Code,Transaction URL\r\n0xA0ba2ACB5846A54834173fB0DD9444F756810f06,0.0001,Success,,https://basescan.org/tx/0x420332...\r\n0xF14F2c49aa90BaFA223EE074C1C33b59891826bF,0.0001,Failed,Insufficient Funds,\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Screen Recording**: \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n- Verify CSV file path in `src/plugins/transactions.csv` is accessible.  \r\n- Ensure wallet initialization works seamlessly for networks without pre-generated wallet details.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n- None.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n1.

Sister PR (client side usage of): https://github.com/ai16z/agent-twitter-client/pull/3/files\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Medium  \r\n- **Potential Impacts**:  \r\n  - Breaks compatibility with existing Twitter V1 API usage if misconfigured.  \r\n  - Errors in authentication if API keys or tokens are invalid or not provided.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n#### What does this PR do?  \r\nThis PR integrates support for the Twitter V2 API in the application while maintaining fallback compatibility with the V1 API for scenarios where V2 credentials are unavailable. Key features include:  \r\n- Authentication using V2 API keys and tokens.  \r\n- Enhanced tweet handling logic to differentiate between V1 and V2.  \r\n- Updated `.env.example` file to include required settings for V2 API.  \r\n\r\n#### What kind of change is this?  \r\n- **Feature**: Adds functionality for Twitter V2 API integration.  \r\n\r\n#### Why are we doing this?  \r\nThe integration of the Twitter V2 API ensures better performance, additional functionality, and alignment with the latest Twitter developer standards. Maintaining V1 as a fallback ensures backward compatibility.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- [x] My changes require a change to the project documentation.  \r\n- [ ] If a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.  \r\n\r\nChanges to `.env.example` and setup instructions for V2 API keys must be added to the documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### Where should a reviewer start?  \r\n1. Review changes in `packages/client-twitter/src/*` for updated API integration logic.  \r\n2. Validate `.env.example` updates for configuration changes.  \r\n\r\n#### Detailed testing steps  \r\n1. Configure `.env` with V2 API keys and tokens.  \r\n2. Run the application to verify successful authentication via V2.  \r\n3. Remove V2 credentials and test fallback to V1.  \r\n4. Perform end-to-end tweet retrieval and posting for both V1 and V2 modes.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n#### Before  \r\nN/A (No V2 integration)\r\n\r\n#### After  \r\nN/A (No UI changes)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n1. Ensure `.env` includes both V1 and V2 API credentials.  \r\n2. Update deployment scripts to validate environment variables for the V2 API.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Database changes  \r\n\r\nNone.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Deployment instructions  \r\n\r\nStandard deployment process; no additional steps required.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Discord username  \r\n\r\n`@0x8664` for project communication and role assignment.

Specifically, the errors occur because the `Plugin` type does not include a `clients` property.\r\n\r\nThe following errors are observed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/index.ts:206:24 - error TS2339: Property 'clients' does not exist on type 'Plugin'.\r\n\r\n206             if (plugin.clients) {\r\n                           ~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nsrc/index.ts:207:45 - error TS2339: Property 'clients' does not exist on type 'Plugin'.\r\n\r\n207                 for (const client of plugin.clients) {\r\n                                                ~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to originate from an outdated or incorrect type definition for `Plugin`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **To Reproduce**\r\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.\r\n2. Run the following commands:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   pnpm install\r\n   pnpm start --characters=\"characters/character.character.json\"\r\n   ```\r\n3. Observe the TypeScript build errors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Expected behavior**\r\nThe project should successfully build and start without errors. Type definitions for `Plugin` should include the `clients` property, or the code should handle cases where `clients` is not defined.\r\n",

Some of them are related to `No test files found, exiting with code 1` (we should fix that for CI purposes) but there's also `token.test.ts` test file that fails with:\r\n```\r\n FAIL  src/tests/token.test.ts [ src/tests/token.test.ts ]\r\nError: Failed to resolve entry for package \"@ai16z/plugin-solana\". The package may have incorrect main/module/exports specified in its package.json.\r\n```\r\nThe thing is that I see `@ai16z/plugin-solana` installed as a dependency. I think the problem related to imported modules is bigger. For example, if you open `agent/src/index.ts`, you can see that most of the imports are not referenced correctly."

The changes primarily involve adding new functionalities and templates for interacting with the Conflux network, which is isolated from other projects.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a plugin for interacting with the Conflux network, providing actions and templates for token transactions such as buying, selling, transferring, and bridging tokens across different spaces within the Conflux network.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation. The README should be updated to include usage instructions for the new plugin functionalities.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nReviewers should start by examining the main plugin configuration and action files, particularly focusing on the `confiPump.ts`, `transfer.ts`, and `bridgeTransfer.ts` files.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Correctly set the character file on your disk (can use the example file at the end)\r\n2. Set the environment arguments correctly (as well as the model key)\r\n\r\n```\r\nCONFLUX_CORE_PRIVATE_KEY=0xxxxxxxxxx\r\nCONFLUX_CORE_SPACE_RPC_URL=https://test.confluxrpc.com\r\nCONFLUX_ESPACE_PRIVATE_KEY=0xxxxxxxxxxx\r\nCONFLUX_ESPACE_RPC_URL=https://evmtest.confluxrpc.com\r\nCONFLUX_MEME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xA016695B5E633399027Ec36941ECa4D5601aBEac\r\n```\r\n3.

I added TanStack Query since it handles all the loading states and caching automatically - way less boilerplate code to write",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nFor a production ready - multi-character Eliza setup, we want to load new characters in runtime via API calls.\r\nWe do not want to restart the Eliza server for each new character.\r\n\r\n_ASSUMPTION:_ \r\nAn api or script exists to store the characters in DB.\r\nThe api uses the same stringToUUID method to create consistent UUIDs for a character and store in DB.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- Allows loading characters from DB during start\r\n- Allows loading characters via REST API from DB during runtime\r\n- The characters are stored in TEXT/JSONB format - similar to the character Agent file in sqlite and postgres respectively\r\n- Securely encrypts each character's secrets using AES-256 encryption and then stores in DB (Decrypt after fetch)\r\n- Proper error handling for all scenarios \r\n    - Character already loaded in runtime\r\n    - Character does not exist in db\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nThis is a new Feature\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\nCurrently \r\n1) For adding any new agent, we need to restart the Eliza server => All the agents and its clients are loaded again - All previous tweets (incase of twitter client), interactions are processed again. Any existing direct or telegram conversation is lost. \r\n2) Not a straight-forward mechanism to add new agents - Now with a REST API - load new agents.\r\n\r\nWhy are we doing this?\r\nTo take a step towards multi-character production setup\r\n\r\n### Code Changes made and why?\r\n1. **Created a new table in postgres and sqlite** - Added in the seed file/script of both DBs\r\n`\r\nexport type CharacterTable = {\r\n    id: UUID;                                                // created from stringToUUID - unique and consistent for name\r\n    name: string;\r\n    characterState: Character;                 // A JSONB or TEXT - that maps the character\r\n    secretsIV?: Secrets;                            // Initialisation Vector for each secrets\r\n};\r\n`\r\n**Also added the above in packages/core/src/types.ts**\r\n2. **in SqliteAdapter and PostgresAdapter** - created a new function to load from this characters table\r\n3. **in Agents/src/index.ts** -> \r\n- Assign Directclient to a global variable - along with set and get methods. This is to allow the same direct client be used for character(agent) runtime creation\r\n- A function loadCharactersFromDb loadCharactersFromDb(\r\n                            characterNames?: string\r\n                        ): Promise<Character[]> \r\n    - if any characterNames argument received, it fetches only those characters from db\r\n    - else fetches all characters\r\n    - This handles encryption and decryption of secrets if secrets are present in a character\r\n    - uses env.ENCRYPTION_KEY\r\n- An express server\r\n   - The server starts only when the env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT == true\r\n   - _Why not use the same express server in DirectClient?_ DirectClient does not have access to the DB methods and all the agent-specific handling methods\r\n   - ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - PORT: default. - 3001, overwritten by env AGENT_PORT\r\n4. **in packages/client-direct/src/index.ts**\r\n- Added ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - This endpoint (is a proxy) that routes request to the agent server's route\r\n   -    Before proxying, checks if AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT  ==true and if agents already in runtime\r\n5. created a file **packages/core/src/crypt.ts**\r\n- This handles the encryption and decryption methods\r\n6. created scripts that parses a character json file or all files in a folder and inserts in DB\r\n- Location: scripts/importCharactersInDB/[postgres/sqlite]/insertInDb.js\r\nRequires env variable\r\n`\r\nPOSTGRES_URL= # if postgres\r\nENCRYPTION_KEY=\"\"\r\nINPUT_PATH=characters # the folder path to load the characters from\r\nSQLITE_DB_PATH= #if you want to change db path Default: agent/data/db.sqlite\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

Fetching from database during start\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=true\r\n- `pnpm start`\r\n- Will function as usual\r\n- if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n2. Loading an agent during runtime\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=false #if true, we can't test load as all characters in db will be loaded\r\n- set env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT=true\r\n- set env ENCRYPTION_KEY= #use the same encryption key used in insertInDB.js script\r\n- set env AGENT_PORT=4000 #can be empty if we want to pick default port 3001\r\n`pnpm start`\r\n- This will load with the default character Eliza\r\n- `curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/load/trump'` - replace port and character name if using different characters\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 1: agent is loaded and we get success code 200\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 2: agent is already loaded and we get error code 409\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 3: agent does not exist in db and we get error code 404\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 4:  Error during agent load - like incorrect twitter - error code 500\r\n-  if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automtated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

            "body": "Original Code (Before Fix)\r\n\r\nThe original code was truncating tweets incorrectly, often cutting them off mid-sentence. The logic did not ensure that tweets ended at a complete sentence or whitespace, leading to awkward, incomplete posts.\r\nProblematic Section\r\n\r\nconst contentLength = 240;\r\n\r\nlet content = slice.slice(0, contentLength);\r\n// if its bigger than 280, delete the last line\r\nif (content.length > 280) {\r\n    content = content.slice(0, content.lastIndexOf(\"\\n\"));\r\n}\r\nif (content.length > contentLength) {\r\n    // slice at the last period\r\n    content = content.slice(0, content.lastIndexOf(\".\"));\r\n}\r\n\r\n// if it's still too long, get the period before the last period\r\nif (content.length > contentLength) {\r\n    content = content.slice(0, content.lastIndexOf(\".\"));\r\n}\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n\r\n    It arbitrarily truncated content at contentLength (240 characters) without ensuring logical sentence breaks.\r\n    The logic to truncate at the last period (.) or newline (\\n) was insufficient for tweets lacking such characters.\r\n    The fallback mechanism could still produce incomplete sentences.\r\n\r\nUpdated Code (After Fix)\r\n\r\nWe introduced a new helper function, truncateToCompleteSentence, to properly truncate the text. This function ensures that:\r\n\r\n    Tweets end at a logical sentence break (e.g., a period).\r\n    If no periods are found, tweets truncate at the nearest whitespace and append an ellipsis (...).\r\n    As a last resort, it hard-truncates the text while adding an ellipsis for readability.\r\n\r\nFixed Section\r\n\r\nconst MAX_TWEET_LENGTH = 280;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Truncate text to fit within the Twitter character limit, ensuring it ends at a complete sentence.\r\n */\r\nfunction truncateToCompleteSentence(text: string): string {\r\n    if (text.length <= MAX_TWEET_LENGTH) {\r\n        return text;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Attempt to truncate at the last period within the limit\r\n    const truncatedAtPeriod = text.slice(0, text.lastIndexOf(\".\", MAX_TWEET_LENGTH) + 1);\r\n    if (truncatedAtPeriod.trim().length > 0) {\r\n        return truncatedAtPeriod.trim();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // If no period is found, truncate to the nearest whitespace\r\n    const truncatedAtSpace = text.slice(0, text.lastIndexOf(\" \", MAX_TWEET_LENGTH));\r\n    if (truncatedAtSpace.trim().length > 0) {\r\n        return truncatedAtSpace.trim() + \"...\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Fallback: Hard truncate and add ellipsis\r\n    return text.slice(0, MAX_TWEET_LENGTH - 3).trim() + \"...\";\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Inside the generateNewTweet function:\r\nconst formattedTweet = newTweetContent.replaceAll(/\\\\n/g, \"\\n\").trim();\r\nconst content = truncateToCompleteSentence(formattedTweet);\r\n\r\nKey Improvements\r\n\r\n    Helper Function: The truncateToCompleteSentence function centralizes truncation logic and ensures consistent handling.\r\n    Logical Truncation:\r\n        First tries to truncate at a period (.).\r\n        Falls back to whitespace if no period is found.\r\n        Finally hard-truncates with an ellipsis if necessary.\r\n    Replaced Inline Logic: The old logic was replaced with a single call to the helper function, ensuring clean and maintainable code.",

I am going through the documentation and following it but when I am faced with the problem, I have to check for the issues or add new issues in the GitHub. There is no way for me to validate if I'm doing something wrong or if it is a bug in the framework. Needing to have all discussions on the GitHub issues slows down the overall learning and development of the framework in my opinion. Group can be used to do preliminary discussions and then issues can be added if necessary. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nStart a discord server and Telegram Group chat to provide support and have preliminary discussions on the issues. This will make the framework more user-friendly to new developers like me.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI have considered going through the issues, searching there and adding new issues but in my opinion, it's can pollute the issues with common issues, beginner mistakes etc.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNo context.

New environment variable pattern: `CHARACTER.YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME.SETTING_NAME`\r\n2. Automatic handling of spaces in character names (converted to underscores)\r\n3. Enhanced settings hierarchy:\r\n   - Character-specific namespaced env variables (highest priority)\r\n   - Character settings from JSON\r\n   - Global environment variables\r\n   - Default values\r\n4. Maintains backward compatibility with existing settings system\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Modified settings loader in `packages/core/src/settings.ts`\r\n- Updated character loading in `packages/agent/src/index.ts`\r\n- Added automatic conversion of character name spaces to underscores\r\n\r\n### Documentation Updates\r\nUpdated documentation to reflect the new feature:\r\n1. Added namespaced settings pattern to secrets management guide\r\n2. Updated configuration guide with new examples\r\n3. Updated agent package documentation with hierarchy explanation\r\n4. Added clear examples for both .env and character.json methods\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes - Documentation has been updated to reflect the new feature:\r\n- Added namespaced settings pattern\r\n- Updated configuration examples\r\n- Updated settings hierarchy explanation\r\n- Added character name handling instructions\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n### Feature Testing\r\n1. Review code changes:\r\n   - `packages/core/src/settings.ts`\r\n   - `packages/agent/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n2. Test functionality:\r\n   ```env\r\n   # Test with simple name\r\n   CHARACTER.TESTBOT.OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test\r\n   \r\n   # Test with spaces in name\r\n   CHARACTER.MY_TEST_BOT.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-other\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Documentation Testing\r\nReview updated docs:\r\n- docs/docs/guides/secrets-management.md\r\n- docs/docs/guides/configuration.md\r\n- docs/docs/packages/agent.md\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Feature Testing:\r\n   - Create character with spaces in name\r\n   - Add namespaced variables to .env\r\n   - Verify correct loading into character settings\r\n   - Test precedence over character.json settings\r\n   - Verify backward compatibility\r\n   - Test global fallback behavior\r\n\r\n2. Documentation Verification:\r\n   - Verify pattern examples are correct\r\n   - Verify hierarchy explanation is clear\r\n   - Verify character name handling is explained\r\n   - Test example configurations\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\nN/A - Feature implementation and documentation changes\r\n",
