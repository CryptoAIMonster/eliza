    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nDuring experimentation, I have found that it was not clear when the image model was not in sync with the base character model. For example, grok image generation API is not publicly available yet, so when asking my character to generate an image, it defaulted to openAI but that code was not set. It is not clear to developers that this is possible (the image gen using a different fallback than the base LLM). In the case where the image model is provided but does not work, it will assume the underlying access token is openAI, and will use groks token. I think this will extend to all other models where the image model API is not aligned with this `core/generation` file. \r\n\r\nI have added some logging and a bit of logic to improve this and will take ownership of integrating grok image gen when it becomes publicly available, I am following along development in the xAI discord. \r\n\r\nCurrently seeking repo permissions to submit the PR for the enhancement to `packages/core/src/generation` and to add grok image gen capability when it becomes available. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSet character model to grok and ask it to generate an image, user will receive error message pointing to openAI env keys not being set. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nUser is informed that the image does not exist or will not match the base model, and that it will default to OPENAI\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"785\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 01 19 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9110b36-391d-4fb6-8012-e81fa4e7a8c9\" />\r\n<img width=\"347\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 01 46 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e522d338-1b16-49d4-9a0e-78e547101f9a\" />\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nThe current logging mechanism does not capture detailed error information when API calls fail, making it difficult to diagnose issues and improve the user experience.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement an enhanced logging system that captures detailed error messages, including the API endpoint, request parameters, and response status codes. This can be achieved by integrating a structured logging library such as Winston or Bunyan.\n\n**Code Example**\n\n```javascript\nconst logger = require('winston');\n\nasync function makeApiCall(endpoint, params) {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetch(endpoint, { method: 'GET', body: JSON.stringify(params) });\n        if (!response.ok) {\n            throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.status} - ${response.statusText}`);\n        }\n        return await response.json();\n    } catch (error) {\n        logger.error('API call failed', { endpoint, params, error: error.message });\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nUsing the current logging mechanism, which only captures the error message without context.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nEnhanced logging will provide better visibility into API failures, allowing for quicker diagnosis and resolution of issues, which will ultimately improve the user experience.",

This allows the application to adapt to different environments at runtime.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. **Use Different Config in Kubernetes:**  \r\n\r\n**Example Kubernetes Configuration:**  \r\n```yaml\r\n\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Pod\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: eliza-instance1\r\nspec:\r\n  containers:\r\n    - name: eliza-container\r\n      image: your-eliza-image\r\n      env:\r\n        - name: ENV_FILE_PATH\r\n          value: \"/config/.env1\"\r\n        - name: CHARACTERS_FILE_PATH\r\n          value: \"/config/charactersXXX.json\"\r\n      volumeMounts:\r\n        - name: config-volume\r\n          mountPath: /config\r\n  volumes:\r\n    - name: config-volume\r\n      configMap:\r\n        name: eliza-config-instance1\r\n```  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. **Load Different Configurations for Different Instances:**  \r\n- Create separate Config for each Eliza instance, with customized content as needed.  \r\n- Reference the corresponding Config in the Kubernetes configuration file to ensure each instance loads the correct configuration.  \r\n\r\n"

The reported issue (#1703) appears to be related to incorrect usage rather than a defect in the logger itself. All test cases demonstrate proper error description display when the logger is used correctly.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nIssue can be closed with:\r\n1. Reference to proper usage patterns\r\n2. Link to new documentation\r\n3. Examples of correct error logging implementation\r\n"

        "body": "Some tips about this \r\n\r\n### Comprehensive Solution for Uniform Application of `trimTokens`\r\n\r\n#### 1. **TLDR (Executive Summary)**\r\n   - **Issue Essence**: Inconsistent application of `trimTokens` across LLM calls leads to context window errors.\r\n   - **Root Cause**: `trimTokens` is not uniformly applied in all LLM calls.\r\n   - **Solution Approach**: Ensure `trimTokens` is applied consistently across all LLM calls.\r\n   - **Impact Assessment**: Prevents context window errors, improves code consistency, and enhances performance.\r\n\r\n#### 2. **Quick Resolution Path**\r\n   - **Immediate Steps**:\r\n     1. Locate the `trimTokens` function in `packages/core/src/generation.ts`.\r\n     2. Identify all LLM calls in the codebase.\r\n     3. Apply `trimTokens` uniformly in each LLM call.\r\n   - **Exact File Locations and Line Numbers**:\r\n     - `packages/core/src/generation.ts` (Line 308)\r\n   - **Required Code Changes**:\r\n     ```typescript\r\n     // Example LLM call without trimTokens\r\n     const response = llmCall(input);\r\n\r\n     // Modified LLM call with trimTokens\r\n     const trimmedInput = trimTokens(input);\r\n     const response = llmCall(trimmedInput);\r\n     ```\r\n   - **Validation Commands**:\r\n     - Run unit tests to ensure no context window errors occur.\r\n     - Test each function that makes LLM calls.\r\n   - **Rollback Procedures**:\r\n     - Revert the changes if errors are introduced.\r\n     - Use version control to track changes.\r\n\r\n#### 3. **Comprehensive Solution**\r\n   - **Detailed Technical Analysis**:\r\n     - The `trimTokens` function truncates the context to the maximum length allowed by the model. Inconsistent application leads to errors when the context window is exceeded.\r\n   - **Step-by-Step Implementation**:\r\n     1. Review `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to locate `trimTokens`.\r\n     2. Identify all functions that make LLM calls.\r\n     3. Apply `trimTokens` before each LLM call.\r\n     4. Test the application to ensure no context window errors occur.\r\n   - **Dependencies and Side Effects**:\r\n     - No additional dependencies required.\r\n     - Ensure `trimTokens` does not truncate important data.\r\n   - **Configuration Changes**:\r\n     - No configuration changes needed.\r\n   - **Environment Requirements**:\r\n     - Ensure the environment supports the updated code.\r\n   - **Database Changes**:\r\n     - No database changes required.\r\n   - **Service Impacts**:\r\n     - Improved stability and performance of LLM calls."

The key focus areas include centralizing dependency management, refactoring database adapters, enhancing testing coverage, improving error handling, and optimizing performance.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Implementation Plan\r\n\r\n### 1. Centralize Dependency Management\r\n- **Objective**: Move shared dependencies to the root `package.json` to avoid version mismatches and streamline updates.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Identify all shared dependencies across the project.\r\n  2. Move these dependencies to the root `package.json`.\r\n  3. Remove duplicate dependencies from individual package `package.json` files.\r\n  4. Update import statements in affected files to reference the centralized dependencies.\r\n\r\n### 2. Refactor Database Adapters\r\n- **Objective**: Ensure all adapters follow a consistent pattern for dependency management and error handling.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Review and standardize the dependency management approach across all database adapters.\r\n  2. Implement consistent error handling patterns using `try-catch` blocks and `elizaLogger`.\r\n  3. Update database interaction methods (`createAccount`, `getAccountById`, `createMemory`, `removeMemory`) to use centralized dependencies.\r\n\r\n### 3. Enhance Testing Coverage\r\n- **Objective**: Increase unit test coverage for all critical methods, especially those interacting with external services.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Identify methods with insufficient test coverage.\r\n  2. Write additional unit tests for these methods.\r\n  3. Ensure tests cover edge cases and error scenarios.\r\n\r\n### 4. Improve Error Handling\r\n- **Objective**: Implement more robust error handling strategies to cover edge cases and provide clearer feedback in logs.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Review existing error handling mechanisms.\r\n  2. Enhance error handling to cover additional edge cases.\r\n  3. Improve error messages and logging for better traceability.\r\n\r\n### 5. Optimize Performance\r\n- **Objective**: Review database interaction patterns to identify and mitigate potential performance bottlenecks.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Analyze current database interaction patterns.\r\n  2. Identify and address potential performance bottlenecks.\r\n  3.

Please describe.**\n\nI'm trying to figure out a way to build an AI agent that only posts quotes on twitter. \n\nUsing V 0.1.7- alpha.2 I can only get the agent to post tweets. It doesn't seem to like posts, repost or quote.\n\nUsing main I can get it to post quotes but it posts them in JSON format. No matter what I do I cannot seem to remove the formatting. It also still tweets even with explicit instructions not to.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nA clear and functional system for configuring what actions the agent can take on twitter or some helpful direction on configuration.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nNew to everything (Building ai agents, working with typescript, GitHub, etc.)",

    "body": "## Feature Request\n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, the system is limited to using TiktokenModel for token trimming, which restricts compatibility with non-OpenAI models. This limitation may hinder the integration of diverse models that could enhance performance and scalability.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a flexible token trimming mechanism that supports a variety of models beyond TiktokenModel. This could involve abstracting the token trimming logic to accommodate different model architectures and tokenization strategies.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nContinuing with the current model-specific approach, but this would limit the flexibility and potential for optimization across different models.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nExpanding support for non-OpenAI models will improve the system's adaptability and allow for better optimization of token trimming processes. This aligns with the goal of enhancing algorithm efficiency and scalability.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nNone at the moment, but tracking this enhancement will facilitate discussions around implementation strategies.",

        "body": "Investigation Summary:\r\n\r\n    PostgresDatabaseAdapter Initialization:\r\n        The PostgresDatabaseAdapter class in packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts is responsible for managing the PostgreSQL database connection and operations. It includes methods for initializing the database, handling errors, and executing queries.\r\n\r\n    Schema Initialization:\r\n        During the init method, the adapter checks if certain tables exist and attempts to initialize the schema by executing SQL scripts. This is where the extension setup might be happening.\r\n\r\n    Potential Issue:\r\n        If the vector extension is being created in the schema initialization process and it already exists, it would lead to the duplicate key error you're seeing.\r\n\r\nRecommended Steps:\r\n\r\n    Check Schema Files:\r\n        Review the schema.sql file in the adapter-postgres package to see if there are any CREATE EXTENSION commands for the vector extension. Ensure that these commands are wrapped in a conditional check to prevent re-creation if the extension already exists.\r\n\r\n    Modify Initialization Logic:\r\n        Update the initialization logic to check for the existence of the extension before attempting to create it. This can be done using a query like:\r\n\r\n        DO $$ BEGIN\r\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector') THEN\r\n                CREATE EXTENSION vector;\r\n            END IF;\r\n        END $$;\r\n\r\n    Database Cleanup:\r\n        As a temporary workaround, manually drop the vector extension from your database and let the initialization process recreate it. Use the following command in your PostgreSQL database:\r\n\r\n        DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS vector;\r\n\r\n"

    "title": "Feature: Add Swarm Agent Capabilities to Eliza",
    "body": "**Description**\r\nAdding a new type of “swarm agent” to the Eliza framework. The goal is to allow multiple agents to coordinate on tasks in a way similar to how single-character agents are currently configured, while supporting unique swarm features such as collective decision-making and interactions among multiple agents.\r\n\r\n**Motivation & Rationale**\r\n\r\nEliza currently supports single “character” agents with various providers, settings, and behaviours.\r\nA natural next step is to introduce the ability for multiple agents to work collectively (swarm) on tasks.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Feature Requirements**\r\n\r\n1. Swarm Agent Configuration\r\n\r\n_Support a dedicated configuration block for swarm agents in a manner similar to single-character agents._\r\n\r\n Allow specifying:\r\n- Number of agents in the swarm.\r\n- Provider definitions for each agent (could be the same or different).\r\n- Traditional settings (e.g., roles, personas, capabilities).\r\n- Additional swarm-specific settings (e.g., rules for agent coordination, speaker settings, collective decision-making thresholds).`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Create Swarm Logic.\r\n\r\n- Configure and Execute swarms by importing the core package in external projects.\r\n- Allow all supported clients to use swarm logic without disrupting current flows(ex: the last agent in a twitter maker team will post as a singular agent akin to current implementation).\r\n- Write dedicated test suite or carefully extend the current tests to confirm proper handling of the majority of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Document feature:\r\n\r\n- How multiple agents can be spawned and coordinated. \r\n- How tasks or sub-tasks are delegated among swarm agents (e.g., parallel vs. sequential).\r\n- How swarm memory storage works.\r\n- Document possible flows.\r\n- How can the utility be extended further. \r\n\r\n",

Write prompt to swap 1 eth with 1 bsc or any chain swap or bridge \r\n4. After giving required details it will never execute your prompt it get an error cannot define toAddress and all details because its not composing actions\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Screenshots**\r\n\r\n1. **Process Action**\r\n     path: `packages\\core\\src\\runtime.ts`\r\n     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/434e038d-8ecc-457a-889b-108fd2836283)\r\n     returns empty object as `Option`\r\n   \r\n2. **Bridge Action handler**\r\n      path: `packages\\plugin-evm\\src\\actions\\bridge.ts`\r\n      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0c41650-7e9e-4558-8b0c-974d73d781e7)\r\n      transferring details of empty object details in bridge action\r\n",
