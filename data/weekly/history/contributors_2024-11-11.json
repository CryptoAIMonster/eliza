The new modular approach will eventually replace `generateObject` and `generateObjectArray` but poses no immediate impact on existing functionality.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the `generateObject` function by introducing a modular approach to handle AI model generation and parsing. The update addresses issue #148, which details inconsistencies in JSON response formatting from the LLM. For instance, action values like `NONE` are inconsistently quoted, causing JSON parsing errors that disrupt program logic. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces provider-specific handlers within `generateObject`, allowing standardized JSON parsing for each model type and reducing the need for custom error-handling code. This is the first part of a two-stage update, with a follow-up PR to fully deprecate `generateObject` and `generateObjectArray` in favor of this approach.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Improvements**: Increases reliability by introducing structured, provider-specific handling.\r\n- **Refactor**: Simplifies `generateObject` and centralizes model-specific parsing logic.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- **Yes**: Documentation should reflect the updated `generateObject` design and the role of provider-specific handlers.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nReview `generateObject`, which now routes requests through `handleProvider`, using specific handlers (e.g., `handleOpenAI`, `handleAnthropic`) that configure JSON response handling for each model. This centralizes parsing and prepares for structured output where supported.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n- Run unit tests on `generateObject` to confirm JSON parsing accuracy with new handlers.\r\n- Test across different AI model providers, especially OpenAI, to ensure JSON responses adhere to expected formats.\r\n- Check logs for consistent error handling and retry logic.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "**Problem:**\r\n\r\nOur open-source project is experiencing rapid growth with numerous contributions from our community members. While we have the infrastructure to create releases, we currently face challenges in ensuring that these releases are reliable and stable. The key issues are:\r\n\r\n- **Broken Test Suite:** Our automated tests are failing, which means we cannot confidently verify the stability and functionality of new code changes.\r\n- **Rapid Code Changes:** With many contributors and fast-moving code, it's difficult to track and integrate changes without introducing new bugs.\r\n- **Unreliable Releases:** Without a consistent and dependable release process, we risk distributing versions of our project that may not meet quality standards.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nTo overcome these challenges and establish a reliable release process, we propose the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Prioritize Fixing the Tests:**\r\n   - **Assess and Repair Tests:** Identify all failing tests and determine the causes. Fix broken tests to ensure they accurately reflect code functionality.\r\n   - **Community Involvement:** Encourage contributors to help fix tests by creating specific issues and assigning tasks.\r\n   - Testing issues can be found with the 'testing' label: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atesting\r\n\r\n2. **Establish Continuous Integration (CI):**\r\n   - **Automate Testing:** Set up a CI system to automatically run the test suite on every commit and pull request. For the most part this is already in place but only runs a basic test currently.\r\n   - **Enforce Test Passing:** Configure the CI to block merging of code that doesn't pass all tests, keeping the main branch stable. We currently have these running on every pull request, but it's not a blocking rule.\r\n\r\n3. **Implement a Branching Strategy:**\r\n   - **Use Feature Branches:** Have contributors work on separate branches for new features or fixes to isolate changes. For the most part this is happening already.\r\n   - **Adopt Release Branches:** Create dedicated branches for preparing releases, allowing for final testing and stabilization.\r\n\r\n4. **Define a Release Workflow:**\r\n   - **Release Types:** Clearly define different release types (e.g., alpha, beta, stable) and their purposes.\r\n   - **Semantic Versioning:** Use semantic versioning to communicate the nature of changes in each release.\r\n\r\n5. **Automate the Release Process:**\r\n   - **Automated Builds and Tagging:** Utilize tools to automate the building of releases and tagging of versions.\r\n   - **Generate Release Notes:** Automatically create release notes from commit messages to document changes. This is already in place and is updated when a tag is created through CI: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n6. **Establish Release Criteria:**\r\n   - **Set Clear Requirements:** Define what must be completed before a release (passing tests, code reviews, updated documentation).\r\n   - **Use a Release Checklist:** Implement a checklist to ensure all criteria are met before releasing.\r\n\r\n7. **Enhance Collaboration and Communication:**\r\n   - **Regular Updates:** Hold regular meetings or send updates to keep everyone informed about release progress.\r\n   - **Transparency:** Make the release roadmap and plans accessible to all contributors.\r\n\r\n8. **Implement Code Reviews and Quality Assurance:**\r\n   - **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require that all code changes are reviewed by at least one other contributor. We've talked about this in discord, but it hasn't been implemented as a rule yet.\r\n   - **Use Quality Tools:** Integrate static analysis and other quality assurance tools to catch issues early.\r\n\r\n9. **Plan for Different Release Channels:**\r\n   - **Stable Releases:** Provide thoroughly tested versions for general use.\r\n   - **Beta and Nightly Builds:** Offer less stable versions for testing new features and gathering feedback.\r\n\r\n10. **Monitor and Iterate:**\r\n    - **Collect Feedback:** After each release, gather input from users and contributors to identify improvements.\r\n    - **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly refine the release process based on feedback and performance metrics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Next Steps:**\r\n\r\n- **Immediate Actions:**\r\n  - **Fix the Test Suite:** Prioritize repairing all broken tests with the help of the community.\r\n  - **Set Up CI System:** Implement a continuous integration pipeline to automate testing and enforce code quality.\r\n\r\n- **Community Engagement:**\r\n  - **Communicate Plans:** Share this proposed solution with the community to align efforts and expectations.\r\n  - **Encourage Participation:** Invite contributors to take active roles in improving the testing and release processes.\r\n\r\n- **Documentation:**\r\n  - **Create Guidelines:** Document the release workflow, branching strategy, and contribution guidelines.\r\n  - **Provide Resources:** Offer tutorials or guides on how to work with the new processes and tools.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy taking these steps, we aim to build a robust and reliable release process that can handle rapid development while maintaining high-quality standards. This will not only improve the stability of our releases but also enhance collaboration within our community, ultimately leading to a better project for all users and contributors.",

Once connected, the bots will communicate through a private back channel to exchange data and execute trades efficiently.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Features**:\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Registry System**: \r\n   - Each bot will register itself in a decentralized registry (e.g., using a lightweight P2P network or distributed ledger technology).\r\n   - Bots will periodically update the registry, checking for new bots or changes in status.\r\n   - The registry will include basic metadata to facilitate discovery, like cryptographic keys for authentication.\r\n   - Possibly services a particular bot provides to other bots that they could pay for in the future. (more on this later)\r\n\r\n2. **Private Back Channel Communication**:\r\n   - Implement a secure, real-time communication protocol, potentially leveraging WebRTC or a similar P2P technology.\r\n   - The protocol should ensure encrypted communication between bots, minimizing the risk of interception.\r\n   - Messages will be designed for minimal latency, suitable for rapid data exchange and trading negotiations.\r\n\r\n3. **Authentication and Security**:\r\n   - Use public-private key cryptography for bot authentication, ensuring only legitimate bots can participate in the network.\r\n   - Establish rules for trust and security, with mechanisms to handle untrusted or malicious bots.\r\n\r\n4. **Efficient Trading Protocol**:\r\n   - Design a protocol that allows bots to share and match order books in a streamlined manner.\r\n   - Ensure trades are executed quickly, with minimal delay, using predefined negotiation rules.\r\n   - Incorporate a fallback mechanism if communication or negotiation fails.\r\n\r\n**Benefits**:\r\n- **Speed**: A dedicated, private communication channel will facilitate faster data exchange compared to public platforms.\r\n- **Security**: Encrypted communication ensures that sensitive trading data remains confidential.\r\n- **Scalability**: The decentralized nature of the registry will support the growth of the network without becoming a bottleneck.\r\n\r\n**Considerations**:\r\n- The system should be resilient to potential attacks, like Sybil attacks, by incorporating strong authentication and trust mechanisms.\r\n- Developing a lightweight and efficient protocol is critical to minimize resource usage and latency.\r\n",

Fix Bot Voice Singleton Issue**\r\nResolved an issue where the bot's voice functionality failed because the service instance was shared as a singleton across different services. Introduced a Map to ensure each service type has its own singleton instance. This guarantees only one instance of each subclass is created and reused.\r\n\r\n**2. Add shouldRespond Function**\r\nAdded a shouldRespond function for the bot's voice feature to control when the bot should respond to user voice inputs.\r\n\r\n**3. Refactor Transcription Process**\r\nRefactored the transcription process by adding a debounce function, ensuring voice messages are processed only when silence is detected.\r\n\r\n**4. Enable Bot to Respond to Text Messages in Voice Channels**\r\nUpdated the bot to handle text messages sent in voice channels.\r\n\r\n**5. Move Template Functions to templates.ts**\r\nRelocated template-related functions to a new templates.ts file for reusability in message.ts and voice.ts.\r\n\r\n**6. Add Optional DISCORD_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID in .env**\r\nIntroduced a new constant, DISCORD_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID, in the .env file to allow users to specify a voice channel the bot should join.\r\n\r\n**7. Implemented Audio Playback Interrupt Mechanism**\r\nAdd a sliding window buffer that monitors the audio volume while the agent is speaking. If the average volume of the user's audio exceeds the defined threshold, it indicates active speaking. When active speaking is detected, stop the agent's current audio playback to avoid overlap.",

(Also, there are `IVideoService` and `IBrowserService`, but I'm not sure if these are necessary for the bot.) Would you prefer that I implement separate methods and instance variables for each of these services, or would you prefer a different approach? Let me know how you'd like to proceed :)"

This means only one instance of each subclass is created and reused. Could you clarify if the intent is different?\r\n\r\nYeah of course anytime! The intent is not different. I just share @lalalune 's concern around multiple instances of service rather than a 1-> many from service -> agents. Happy to add more context, but will defer @lalalune as he has more context!"

            "body": "**Description:**\r\n\r\nThe Eliza project is gaining traction, and many developers are forking the repository to create custom agents or specialized implementations. This distributed development model is a strength, but it also creates a challenge: managing code divergence and ensuring interoperability across the growing Eliza ecosystem. This ticket aims to establish a community-driven plan for addressing this challenge, fostering collaboration, and maximizing code reuse while allowing for customization and innovation within individual forks.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\n* **Multiple Diverging Forks:** As more developers fork Eliza, the ecosystem will naturally fragment into various specialized implementations.\r\n* **Increased Merge Complexity:** Merging changes between forks, or between forks and the main repository, will become increasingly complex and error-prone as divergence increases.\r\n* **Maintenance Overhead:**  Each fork incurs its own maintenance burden, requiring developers to track upstream changes, resolve merge conflicts, and ensure compatibility.\r\n* **Duplication of Effort and Reinventing the Wheel:** Developers in different forks might unknowingly duplicate efforts by re-implementing similar features.\r\n* **Reduced Interoperability:**  Divergence can lead to reduced interoperability between different Eliza agents or implementations.\r\n\r\n**Goals:**\r\n\r\n* **Minimize Divergence (Where Feasible):** Encourage practices that minimize unnecessary code divergence across forks.\r\n* **Facilitate Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:** Foster communication and collaboration between maintainers of different forks and the core Eliza team.\r\n* **Streamline Merging and Integration:** Establish best practices and potentially develop tools for efficiently merging changes between forks and the main repository.\r\n* **Maximize Code Reuse:**  Promote modular design and encourage the development of reusable plugins and components that can be shared across the ecosystem.\r\n* **Maintain Core Eliza Stability:**  Ensure that core Eliza functionality remains stable and reliable while allowing for innovation and customization within forks.\r\n\r\n**Near-Term Plan (Community-Driven):**\r\n\r\n1. **Fork Registry (Website or GitHub Page):** Create a central registry of known Eliza forks. This registry could include project descriptions, contact information for maintainers, and links to the forked repositories.  This facilitates discovery and collaboration.\r\n\r\n2. **Communication Channels (Discord, Forum):**  Establish dedicated communication channels (e.g., a Discord server, a forum category) for discussing fork management, sharing best practices, and coordinating development efforts.\r\n\r\n3. **Modularization and Plugin Development:**  Encourage developers to refactor fork-specific code into modular plugins or extensions that can be easily shared and integrated with other Eliza implementations.\r\n\r\n4. **Standardized Plugin Interface:**  Develop and document a clear, standardized interface for creating Eliza plugins.  This promotes interoperability and simplifies plugin integration.\r\n\r\n5. **Shared Test Suite:**  Create a shared test suite that covers core Eliza functionality.  Encourage fork maintainers to incorporate this test suite into their continuous integration pipelines to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n6. **Documentation:**  Create documentation and tutorials on best practices for forking Eliza, managing divergence, and contributing back to the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Future Considerations (Speculative):**\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Merging Tools:**  Explore and potentially develop automated merging tools that can help resolve conflicts and integrate changes between forks more efficiently.\r\n2. **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) Workflows:** Investigate whether alternative version control systems or workflows (like Git submodules or subtree merging) could facilitate managing multiple forks.\r\n3. **Inter-Agent Communication Protocol:** If AI-driven code synchronization is a long-term goal, develop a protocol or language for communication between agents managing different forks.\r\n4. **Federated Learning for Agents:**  Explore the potential of federated learning techniques, allowing agents in different forks to collaboratively train and improve shared models without directly exchanging sensitive data.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n\r\n* A community-driven plan is established and documented for managing divergence across the Eliza ecosystem.\r\n* The plan includes specific steps for facilitating collaboration, streamlining merging, maximizing code reuse, and maintaining core Eliza stability.\r\n* The plan is actively communicated and promoted within the Eliza community.\r\n* Tools and resources (fork registry, communication channels, shared test suite) are created to support the plan's implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ticket expands the scope to address the broader challenge of managing multiple forks within the Eliza ecosystem. The key shift is towards a community-driven approach, emphasizing collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the development of shared resources and standards. This fosters a more vibrant and sustainable ecosystem while allowing individual forks the flexibility to innovate and adapt Eliza to their specific needs.",

Specifically:\r\n1. Adds HEURIST_API_KEY configuration\r\n2. Implements Heurist model provider integration\r\n3. Adds Heurist model configurations\r\n4. Updates API key handling logic to support Heurist provider\r\n5. Adds model settings configuration including temperature, tokens, and other parameters\r\n\r\nThe integration allows us to leverage Heurist's cost-effective infrastructure for accessing open source LLMs while maintaining our existing architecture patterns.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to document:\r\n- New HEURIST_API_KEY configuration option (free API key can be applied [here](https://dev-api-form.heurist.ai/) )\r\n- Available Heurist models and their capabilities\r\n- Model configuration parameters\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the model configuration in packages/core/src/models.ts\r\n2. Check API key handling in .env.example\r\n3. Review the generateText implementation for Heurist in packages/core/src/generation.ts\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure HEURIST_API_KEY in environment\r\n2. Test text generation using configured model by `pnpm start`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\nN/A - Backend API integration changes only\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n- Requires setting up HEURIST_API_KEY in production environment\r\n- No database changes required\r\n",

Added optional field for formattedResponses in State object. Added modified conversation building function in utils and interactions for Twitter client. \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nPR changes the Interactions client for twitter client to give agent context about entire twitter thread rather than just the most immediate/recent reply. Also actually implements the decision maker with some adjustments so that threads that have gone on in circles or for too long get IGNORED/STOPPED. (reduce slop model collapse)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\nAs soon as you tag 100 Eliza agents in a thread, they end up in an infinite loop of replying and collapse towards the same topics of existential dread (this needs to be studied more btw).

                "body": "### Dockerfile Audit and Suggested Improvements\r\n\r\nThe current Dockerfile implementation has several areas that could be improved to enhance performance, security, and maintainability. Here\u2019s a detailed list of suggested changes:\r\n\r\n1. **No `.dockerignore` File**\r\n   - Without a `.dockerignore`, unnecessary files and folders (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, logs) are included in the Docker build context. This increases image size and build time.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude files not needed in the container.\r\n\r\n2. **Inefficient Layer Caching**\r\n   - Dependencies are installed multiple times, which prevents effective caching. Additionally, using separate `ADD` commands for configuration files results in multiple layers.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Consolidate the `ADD` commands for configuration files and install dependencies in a single step. Run `pnpm i` only once after adding all configuration files.\r\n\r\n3. **Redundant `RUN pnpm i` Commands**\r\n   - Dependencies are installed three times throughout the Dockerfile, increasing build time.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Install dependencies once, after copying all necessary configuration files, to streamline the build process.\r\n\r\n4. **Lack of Multi-Stage Build for Production**\r\n   - A single-stage build may result in unnecessary development dependencies being included in the final image, which increases image size and introduces security risks.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Use a multi-stage build to separate build dependencies from the final production image, ensuring only essential files are included.\r\n\r\n5. **Unoptimized `CMD` Command**\r\n   - The `CMD [\"tail\", \"-f\", \"/dev/null\"]` keeps the container idle and suggests the container isn\u2019t configured to run the application.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Replace `CMD` with the actual command to start the application, such as `CMD [\"pnpm\", \"start\"]`.\r\n\r\n6. **Direct Inclusion of Environment Variables (`.env` File)**\r\n   - Adding the `.env` file with `ADD` exposes sensitive information in the Docker image. This can pose security risks if the image is pushed to a registry.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Use Docker secrets or pass environment variables at runtime to secure sensitive data.\r\n\r\n7. **Lack of Non-Root User**\r\n   - The container runs as the root user by default, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if exploited.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Create a non-root user and run the application under this user. Example:\r\n     ```Dockerfile\r\n     RUN adduser -D appuser\r\n     USER appuser\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n8. **Missing Port Exposure**\r\n   - If the application is meant to run a service (e.g., a web server), the container should expose the relevant port.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Add an `EXPOSE <port>` statement for documentation and networking purposes.\r\n\r\n9. **Lack of `.npmrc` Caching**\r\n   - If `.npmrc` contains specific registry or authentication settings, it should be added before dependency installation for caching purposes and authentication consistency.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Add `.npmrc` before running `pnpm i` to leverage caching and reduce unnecessary network requests.\r\n\r\n10. **Unused `docs` Directory**\r\n    - Adding `docs` to the image increases its size without being used by the application.\r\n    - **Suggested Fix**: Remove the `docs` directory from the Dockerfile unless it\u2019s necessary for runtime.\r\n\r\n11. **Inconsistent Dependency Installation**\r\n    - Multiple installations of dependencies without clearing caches or pinning versions may lead to conflicts or unexpected updates.\r\n    - **Suggested Fix**: Ensure dependencies are installed consistently in one step, and pin specific versions where possible.\r\n\r\n12. **Missing Health Checks**\r\n    - Without a health check, monitoring systems like Kubernetes cannot accurately assess the container\u2019s health.\r\n    - **Suggested Fix**: Add a health check for better monitoring, e.g.:\r\n      ```Dockerfile\r\n      HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:<port> || exit 1\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Suggested Refactored Dockerfile\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a refactored Dockerfile with the suggested improvements:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\n# Stage 1: Build dependencies in a temporary stage\r\nFROM node:22-alpine AS builder\r\n\r\n# Install required global dependencies\r\nRUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++ \\\r\n    && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\r\n\r\n# Set working directory\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\n# Copy essential config files\r\nCOPY pnpm-workspace.yaml package.json .npmrc pnpm-lock.yaml ./\r\n\r\n# Install dependencies\r\nRUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile\r\n\r\n# Copy source code\r\nCOPY tsconfig.json ./\r\nCOPY docs ./docs\r\nCOPY packages ./packages\r\nCOPY scripts ./scripts\r\nCOPY characters ./characters\r\nCOPY src ./src\r\n\r\n# Optional: build step if using TypeScript or other build process\r\n# RUN pnpm build\r\n\r\n# Stage 2: Production image\r\nFROM node:22-alpine\r\n\r\n# Install dependencies required for the final runtime\r\nRUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++ \\\r\n    && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\r\n\r\n# Create a non-root user and switch to it\r\nRUN adduser -D appuser\r\nUSER appuser\r\n\r\n# Set working directory\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\n# Copy built files from the builder stage\r\nCOPY --from=builder /app /app\r\n\r\n# Expose application port if running a web server\r\nEXPOSE 3000  # Adjust port as needed\r\n\r\n# Add health check to ensure the app is running\r\nHEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000 || exit 1\r\n\r\n# Set environment variables to configure runtime model settings\r\nENV NODE_ENV=production\r\n# Add more default environment variables if needed, e.g., DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID, etc.\r\n\r\n# Default command to run the application\r\nCMD [\"pnpm\", \"start\"]"

The error message indicates that the better-sqlite3 module was compiled with NODE_MODULE_VERSION 127, while my current Node.js version requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 131.\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\nTry rebuilding the module:\r\npnpm rebuild better-sqlite3\r\n\r\nReinstall the better-sqlite3 module:\r\npnpm uninstall better-sqlite3 && pnpm install better-sqlite3\r\n\r\nEnsure the version of Node.js being used matches the version the module was compiled for.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\nI am using Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage different Node.js versions.\r\nThe project is running in a Linux environment, but my system is dual-booted with Windows. I am using a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment.\r\nExpected Behavior\r\nI expect the server to start successfully, but instead, the error prevents the agent from starting.\r\n\r\n",
