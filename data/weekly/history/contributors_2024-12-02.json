Any context or related work?  \r\nText-based generation of JSON using LLMs is prone to errors like missing brackets, invalid types, or inconsistent structures. Moving to a typesafe structured output guarantees that JSON complies with predefined schemas, improving both developer experience and system stability.  \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?  \r\n- **My changes require a change to the project documentation.**  \r\n- Updated docs to:  \r\n  - Reflect new structured output implementation.  \r\n  - Mark text-based generation as deprecated.  \r\n\r\n# Testing  \r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps   \r\nN/A just a rename\r\n# Deploy Notes  \r\nNo special deployment steps required. \r\n\r\n# Database changes  \r\nNone.  \r\n\r\n# Deployment instructions  \r\nStandard deployment process applies.  \r\n\r\n## Discord username  \r\n0x8664\r\n\r\n---  \r\n",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nCurrently the Solana and EVM Plugin are not aware of the TEE Plugin and a lot of custom code and configuration must be done to add deployment of Eliza agents in a TEE. This PR solves this issue by making the TEE Plugin an opt-in feature that allows developers to build a TEE compatible Eliza Agent to deploy in a Intel TDX Server running the Dstack SDK.\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds a new env variable called `TEE_MODE` with values of `OFF`, `LOCAL`, `DOCKER`, `PRODUCTION`. When the  `TEE_MODE` is set to an option other than `OFF` or `undefined` then the agent will utilize the TEE Plugin to handle wallet generations for the Solana Plugin.\r\n\r\nEvery time a key is derived to generate a wallet in the Solana Plugin the following happens:\r\n- Derives an ed25519 key based on the value of the `WALLET_SECRET_SALT`\r\n- Generates a Remote Attestation Quote with the `reportdata` that includes a JSON string of `{agentId: ${agentId}, publicKey: ${publicKey}}`\r\n- In the logs, a user can take the RA Quote and the `reportdata` to verify publicly at https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ \r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeature\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation. There will be another step in this PR to add documentation within the advanced section to step developers through setting up their Eliza Agent to be TEE compatible. This documentation will take developers through the process of\r\n- Building an Agent locally with TEE_MODE enabled\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a locally deployed Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a docker container of the Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the Eliza Agent within a Real TEE via Phala Network's Dstack Dashboard\r\n- How to verify a Remote Attestation on https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ and validate the `reportdata` passed into the RA Quote\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nRun through existing Solana Plugin tests before merge.\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nA reviewer should start by running the existing codebase with `TEE_MODE` set to `OFF` to ensure functionality hasn't broken.\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n- Run existing test sets that have TEE_MODE set `OFF` or `undefined` and pass all tests\r\n- Set `TEE_MODE` to `LOCAL` and run through a local test by launching the docker TEE Simulator then building and starting the project on the development machine where the docker TEE Simulator is running \r\n- Set `TEE_MODE` to `DOCKER` and run through a docker test by launching the docker TEE Simulator then building a docker image on a `linux/amd64` platform where the docker TEE Simulator is running\r\n- (Optional: I can record a start from scratch video) Set `TEE_MODE` to `PRODUCTION` and run through a production deployment by launching in an Intel TDX Server with Dstack SDK setup to deploy via a dashboard\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

The build process fails when attempting to resolve the image generation plugin import in `defaultCharacter.ts`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- 1. Clone the eliza repository (v0.1.5-alpha.5)\r\n- 2. Import and add the `imageGenerationPlugin` to Eliza in `defaultCharacter.ts`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\nimport { imageGenerationPlugin } from \"@ai16z/plugin-image-generation\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [imageGenerationPlugin],\r\n```\r\n- 3. Run `pnpm build` in the project root\r\n- 4. Build fails with error message indicating it cannot resolve \"@ai16z/plugin-image-generation\" in defaultCharacter.ts\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe build process should successfully compile all packages including @ai16z/eliza. The @ai16z/plugin-image-generation package should be properly resolved as it's listed in the workspace packages.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- Project version: v0.1.5-alpha.\r\n- Build tool: turbo 2.3.3\r\n- Package manager: pnpm\r\n- The package @ai16z/plugin-image-generation is listed in the workspace scope but fails to resolve during build\r\n- Error occurs in the ESM build step using tsup\r\n- File causing error: packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts\r\n\r\n\r\n**Exact error:**\r\n```sh\r\nUSER@MACHINE MINGW64

If a plugin requires an initial setup such as setting up a wallet or a GOAT plugin (e.g adding Polymarket or Uniswap plugins) there is no way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nUpdate the GOAT plugin to get passed a `getSecrets` function for the specific character it is adding actions to. This allows GOAT to check the secrets/env variables and configure its plugins accordingly when being initialized.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements: This change allows developers to install GOAT plugins easily such as Polymarket, Uniswap and Coingecko. It also makes it easier to update the plugin to support multi-chain.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Go to `plugin-goat`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Make sure you have an `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` for Base set\r\n2. Comment out `evmPlugin` in `src/agent.ts`\r\n3. Run the agent and prompt it with: What's the USDC balance of `0x18Bead774f927Af586F86F6d054C269416E163DD`\r\n4. Should give you the balance of `0x18Bead774f927Af586F86F6d054C269416E163DD`\r\n\r\nTo test actions on Base Sepolia simply:\r\n1. Go to `plugin-goat/src/wallet.ts` and change\r\n```typescript\r\nconst chain = base \r\n```\r\nto\r\n```typescript\r\nconst chain = sepolia\r\n```\r\n2. Make sure `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` works for Sepolia\r\n3. Run the agent!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\naguspunk\r\n",

Here's the sequence:\r\n\r\n1. First call:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst responseMessages = await callback(responseContent);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Then the callback is passed to `processActions`:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait this.runtime.processActions(\r\n    memory,\r\n    responseMessages,\r\n    state,\r\n    callback  // <-- Same callback passed here\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Inside `processActions`, the action handler might call the callback again:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait action.handler(this, message, state, {}, callback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you could:\r\n\r\n1. Either modify the callback to be single-use:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts\r\nconst createCallback = () => {\r\n    let used = false;\r\n    return async (content: Content, files: any[]) => {\r\n        if (used) {\r\n            elizaLogger.warn(\"Callback already used, skipping\");\r\n            return [];\r\n        }\r\n        used = true;\r\n        // ... rest of callback logic ...\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst callback = createCallback();\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Or create separate callbacks for the initial response and actions:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts\r\nconst responseMessages = await callback(responseContent);\r\n\r\n// Create a new callback for actions that doesn't create memories\r\nconst actionCallback: HandlerCallback = async (content: Content, files: any[]) => {\r\n    try {\r\n        if (!content?.text.trim()) {\r\n            elizaLogger.warn(\"Skipping empty content\");\r\n            return [];\r\n        }\r\n        return await sendMessageInChunks(\r\n            message.channel as TextChannel,\r\n            content.text,\r\n            message.id,\r\n            files\r\n        );\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n        console.error(\"Error in action callback:\", error);\r\n        return [];\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nawait this.runtime.processActions(\r\n    memory,\r\n    responseMessages,\r\n    state,\r\n    actionCallback\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second approach might be better as it makes the distinction between response handling and action handling clearer.\r\n"

Added multichain support, the current version of the plugin only supported mainnet and Base, and there have been several requests for additional EVM chain support.\r\n\r\n- The plugin lacked test coverage, so we initiated tests alongside the feature development, starting with WalletProvider.\r\n- Refactored the plugin to make it more test-friendly and modular.\r\n- Added multichain support (for viem chains)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Improvements: Refactoring, cleaning, and testing of the existing plugin.\r\n- Features: Non-breaking changes to add EVM multichain support. The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility. Transfers are not yet fully functional, as noted in [Issue #735](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/735). This will be addressed in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup. No changes are required at this time.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## How was it tested\r\n\r\n- Ran test scripts \r\n- Verified functionality through agent interactions:\r\n<img width=\"627\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 2 42 13\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a99dea38-560f-46e4-8826-4e98be175486\">\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nFile: packages/plugin-evm/src/tests/wallet.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNo manual testing is required; automated tests have been implemented and cover the new functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou",

This PR focuses on enabling multichain support and making the plugin more test-friendly via TDD + a foundation to extend the plugin with more features.\n\nThe GOAT plugin does look interesting, and I\u2019ll take a closer look to see if it aligns with the goals here.\n\nLet me know if you think it\u2019s better to pivot entirely to GOAT, or if continuing with this plugin (and fixing the mentioned issues) is a good path forward!"

Adding `customSystemPrompt` parameter to generateText function for image gen system prompt\r\n2. Implementing structured prompt engineering for image generation\r\n3. Creating detailed prompt generation guidelines with specific steps\r\n4. Setting up a standardized prompt structure for consistency\r\n5. Adding style-specific prompt customization\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?\r\nTo improve image generation quality by providing structured, detailed prompts that consider key aspects like:\r\n- Main subject focus\r\n- Environment and setting\r\n- Lighting and atmosphere\r\n- Color relationships\r\n- Composition guidelines\r\n- Style integration\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to document:\r\n- New `customSystemPrompt` parameter in generateText\r\n- Image prompt structure and guidelines\r\n- Style customization options\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the generateText changes in `packages/core/src/generation.ts`\r\n2. Check the image prompt system in image generation implementation\r\n3. Examine the structured prompt generation workflow\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nI tested locally by running `pnpm start` with a new character that had ModelProviderName.HEURIST as the modelProvider and \"direct\" in the clients. Everything seemed to work well.\r\n\r\n## Deploy Notes\r\nNo special deployment steps required. Feature is automatically active when using the plugin-image-generation functionality.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\ntao8617\r\n\r\n",

This was implemented originally by @oberlinstands and probably had a different dev workflow bc the eliza was not built and only the packages were installed. This is why the `/dev/null` may have been required bc the dev needed to build eliza then `pnpm start` inside the container.\r\n\r\nIn the package.json file we can see `pnpm docker` will execute this script for all 3 docker commands `build`, `run` and `bash`.  \r\n```\r\n\"docker:build\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh build\",\r\n\"docker:run\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh run\",\r\n\"docker:bash\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh bash\",\r\n\"docker:start\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh start\",\r\n\"docker\": \"pnpm docker:build && pnpm docker:run && pnpm docker:bash\",\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/438c1f1400e365510cae9c19dfc35ca4f663512d/package.json#L20C10-L20C78\r\n\r\nIf checking the `docker run` script, we can see that the command is executed based on this logic\r\n```\r\n # Start building the docker run command\r\nCMD=\"docker run --platform linux/amd64 -p 3000:3000 -d\"\r\n\r\n# Add base mounts\r\nfor mount in \"${BASE_MOUNTS[@]}\"; do\r\n   CMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/$mount\\\"\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Add package mounts\r\nfor package in \"${PACKAGES[@]}\"; do\r\n   CMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/packages/$package/src:/app/packages/$package/src\\\"\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Add core types mount separately (special case)\r\nCMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/packages/core/types:/app/packages/core/types\\\"\"\r\n\r\n# Add container name and image\r\nCMD=\"$CMD --name eliza eliza\"\r\n\r\n# Execute the command\r\neval $CMD\r\n;;\r\n ```\r\n \r\nFor the last command `docker bash`, then we see that this. may be the culprit since it will try run \r\n```\r\n# Check if the container is running before executing bash\r\nif [ \"$(docker ps -q -f name=eliza)\" ]; then\r\n   docker exec -it eliza bash\r\nelse\r\n   echo \"Container 'eliza' is not running. Please start it first.\"\r\n   exit 1\r\nfi\r\n;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run a test on `pnpm docker`, I will see this result:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3596cc8b-12ae-452c-bb7c-1fdf648c8ccc)\r\n\r\nI think the change we are looking for is to remove bash command from the `pnpm docker` package script & let the docker image be built and run. If there are errors whenever this happens, then execute pnpm docker:bash to debug the docker image & find out what the problems are."

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n**Risk Level**: Low  \r\nAdding a new flag `non-interactive` that defaults to skipping `chat()` should not affect existing functionality unless explicitly enabled. The main risk is around unintended bypass of user input under edge cases.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds a `non-interactive` flag to prevent running the `chat()` function and avoid waiting for user input. This is particularly useful for environments such as Cloud platforms where interactive sessions are not feasible and can cause the application to hang.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `non-interactive` flag is added to the `CMD` in the Dockerfile as the default.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nRunning the application in a non-interactive environment such as Cloud platforms caused the process to hang due to waiting for terminal input. Adding this flag makes the application more robust for deployment in such scenarios.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\nMy changes **do not** require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in the `Dockerfile` for the updated `CMD` with the `non-interactive` flag.\r\n- Review the changes in `/agent/src/index.ts` where the `non-interactive` flag is implemented and its logic for skipping `chat()`.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Run the application locally without the `non-interactive` flag and verify that `chat()` runs as expected.\r\n2. Run the application locally with the `non-interactive` flag and confirm it bypasses `chat()` and does not wait for user input.\r\n3. Build and run the updated Docker image to ensure the `non-interactive` flag is applied by default and prevents hanging in Cloud environments.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nNo special deployment steps are required. Ensure the updated Docker image is pushed to the appropriate registry.\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\nBuild and deploy the updated Docker image as usual.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet me know if anything else needs tweaking! \ud83d\ude0a\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n@rarepepi\r\n-->\r\n",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now actions are mostly seen as \"side effect\"  happening next to an answer sent by the agent.\r\nThere is no automated way to get the agent to call an action, interpret the result, and answer with that interpretation (which is what I would expect coming from OpenAI actions that are APIs that their runtime call and then get the result interpreted by the agent)\r\n\r\nRight now if I ask my agent: `what actions can you perform right now in the game?`\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\"] \r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThere are two things that could be done. \r\nThe simple one would just have the action result override the answer from the agent (so in the previous example, the first text `I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?` wouldn't even be sent to the client).\r\n\r\nThe complicated one, would have do a second back-and forth with the agent, after getting the action result, in order to interpret that result.\r\n\r\nA) simple:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\", type: \"OVERRIDE_ANSWER\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n> here, simply adding a \"type\" (or any other field name) with value `OVERRIDE_ANSWER` to the action result, would tell the system to not send the agent answer, only the action result, to the client\r\n\r\nB) complicated:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ data: ['dice', 'roulette', 'blackjack'], type: \"ACTION_RESULT_INTERPRETATION\" }`\r\n3 - Agent request: `{ prompt: \"You were just asked 'what actions can you perform right now in the game?' which triggered the action 'LIST_GAME_ACTIONS' and the result was ['dice', 'roulette', 'blackjack']. Can you compose an answer knowing the question and the result?\" }`\r\n4- Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play dice, roulette and blackjack\"}`\r\n5 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play dice, roulette and blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n> here, there is a second message sent to the agent, telling it \"this is what happened, this is the result, can you interpret it?\". This would be done again through some \"type\"  (`ACTION_RESULT_INTERPRETATION`) on the action result, which would be some kind of \"operation\" to be done by the runtime.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nRight now as an alternative, I go with the \"simple\" solution, and at the client level, if there is any message with a `type: \"OVERRIDE_ANSWER\"` I remove all other messages from the returned messages.\r\n\r\nBut this forces me to do a fork of all the clients to add that filter, when it could be done earlier in the runtime / pipeline.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'm comparing \"actions\" to OpenAI actions where the agent detects that an action is possible from the prompt and a list of actions that are submitted (it also detects parameters)\r\nThen the agent call the API with those parameters\r\nThe API answers, and the agent interpret the result, create a constructed answer, and returns that answer.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to have a similar behavior for actions here\r\n",

            "body": "# Add Slack Integration for Eliza AI Agent\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis PR adds a new Slack client integration for the Eliza AI agent, enabling seamless communication between Slack workspaces and the Eliza AI system. The integration includes robust message handling, conversation management, and standalone example scripts for easy testing and deployment.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Full Slack bot integration with event handling and message management\r\n- Message deduplication system to prevent duplicate responses\r\n- Thread-aware conversation handling\r\n- Support for attachments and media files\r\n- Conversation summarization capabilities\r\n- Standalone example scripts for testing and development\r\n\r\n## Example Scripts\r\nThe package includes several standalone scripts in `packages/client-slack/src/examples/`:\r\n\r\n1. **standalone-example.ts**\r\n   - Basic bot setup and connection\r\n   - Demonstrates message sending, threading, and image attachments\r\n   - Includes error handling and port management\r\n\r\n2. **standalone-summarize.ts**\r\n   - Shows conversation summarization capabilities\r\n   - Demonstrates handling attachments and threaded discussions\r\n\r\n3. **standalone-attachment.ts**\r\n   - Comprehensive attachment handling\r\n   - File upload and sharing capabilities\r\n\r\n## Setup and Configuration\r\n### 1. Slack App Creation\r\n![Slack App Creation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIFlowML/eliza_aiflow/add-slack-plugin/packages/client-slack/src/examples/sc_01.png)\r\n- Create a new Slack app using the provided manifest\r\n- Configure bot permissions and event subscriptions\r\n\r\n### 2. Bot Configuration\r\n![Bot Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIFlowML/eliza_aiflow/add-slack-plugin/packages/client-slack/src/examples/sc_02.png)\r\n- Set up OAuth scopes and bot token\r\n- Configure event subscriptions and interactive components\r\n\r\n## Testing Instructions\r\n### Running Example Scripts\r\n1. Set up environment variables in `.env`:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   SLACK_APP_ID=your_app_id\r\n   SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\r\n   SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\r\n   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_signing_secret\r\n   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token\r\n   SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=your_verification_token\r\n   SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=test_channel_id\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run the basic example:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-example.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Test summarization:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-summarize.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4.

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMany image generation services such as FAL, Stable Diffusion, etc. have \"safety checkers\" that ensure prompts are appropriate.\r\nThese have several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Additional latency: These checks are done via an LLM, which can add unnecessary latency.\r\n2. Unpredictable / incorrect outputs: Since the checks use LLMs, their output can be overly restrictive or random, causing unpredictable behavior.\r\n3. Not necessary: Some use cases don't require the safety checker.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we at [daojones.ai](daojones.ai) ([@DAOJonesPumpAI](x.com/DAOJonesPumpAI) on X.com) have found this is overly restrictive and have written a custom image generation application that disables it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe want to set the FAL configuration for our image requests.\r\nWe need to set `enable_safety_checker` to `false` while also setting `safety_tolerance` to `6` (the most tolerant setting).\r\nSince these options are not uniformly supported by the different APIs, we will just add an \"escape hatch\" configuration `imageSettings.fal`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Turning safety checker off globally: This would work for our use case but could be a breaking change for other use cases.\r\n2. Adding a global `allowNsfw` flag: This requires reconciling this with other APIs and determining what settings it would correspond to.\r\n3. Adding the `enableSafetyChecker` / `safetyTolerance` flags at the top level of `imageSettings`: this would pollute the global namespace.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n",

This PR implements a plugin for agents to be able to interact with Era. \r\n\r\nIn this first version, only the `transfer` function is supported. Further work will extend this functionality. \r\n\r\nMany more L2s are being build w/ the ZK Stack (the open source framework used to build ZKsync Era), and this work can be extended/modified to support these as they come online.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nWe're seeing a huge proliferation of AI agents being able to manage value on-chain. This is similar conceptually to these plugins (e.g. `plugin-solana` and others)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis plugin follows the standards set by other crypto integrations, including things like the `SEND_TOKENS` action. Changes to the overall project documentation don't seem to be required.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are in `plugin-zksync-era`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. In `.env` you should set the value for `ZKSYNC_ADDRESS` (this is the public address for the agent account) and `ZKSYNC_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key for the same account).\r\n2. To test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. Coinbase can be used to send ZK directly to an address on ZKsync Era, but I am also happy to provide tokens for reviewers (I'll send ZK tokens to reviewers that need it). \r\n3. Run the agent and prompt it with: \"send 0.5 ZK to <an address on ZKsync Era>\" - e.g. \"send 1 ZK to 0xee0c40F86544a8b0616BC827728f714a8B4cEeE7\"\r\n4. Assuming you had 1 ZK to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. `Transfer completed successfully! \"tx: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"`\r\n5. The tx hash can be checked on the ZKsync block explorer at https://explorer.zksync.io, e.g. https://explorer.zksync.io/tx/0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nanthonykrose\r\n",

Does converting to this standard protocol enhance that at all? I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nBased on the extensive MCP documentation provided, here are some hypothetical benefits of integrating MCP into this codebase:\r\n\r\n1. **Standardized AI-System Communication**\r\n    - The codebase could leverage MCP's standardized protocol for communication between the AI (Claude) and various system resources\r\n    - This would provide a more structured and secure way to handle interactions compared to custom implementations\r\n\r\n2. **Resource Management**\r\n    - MCP's resource system could help manage character files and data in a standardized way\r\n    - Characters could be exposed as MCP resources with proper MIME types and metadata\r\n    - Real-time updates to character data could leverage MCP's resource subscription system\r\n\r\n3. **Tool Integration**\r\n    - MCP tools could provide standardized ways to:\r\n      - Read/write character files\r\n      - Validate character data\r\n      - Perform character-related operations\r\n      - Handle file system operations securely\r\n    - Tools could be exposed with clear schemas and descriptions for the AI to understand\r\n\r\n4. **Security Benefits**\r\n    - MCP's security model would provide better isolation and control over what the AI can access\r\n    - Built-in validation and sanitization of inputs\r\n    - Controlled access to file system and other resources\r\n    - Clear error handling patterns\r\n\r\n5. **Development Benefits**\r\n    - Better debugging capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Standardized logging and error reporting\r\n    - Clear separation between AI capabilities and system operations\r\n    - Type safety through SDK integrations\r\n    - Built-in progress reporting for long operations\r\n\r\n6. **Extensibility**\r\n    - Easy addition of new capabilities through MCP servers\r\n    - Potential to integrate with other tools and services\r\n    - Standardized way to add new features that interact with the AI\r\n\r\n7. **Testing & Maintenance**\r\n    - Better testing capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Clear protocol specifications make maintenance easier\r\n    - Standard patterns for error handling and logging\r\n    - Built-in tools for debugging and monitoring\r\n\r\nThis would represent a shift from custom implementations to a standardized protocol, potentially making the codebase more maintainable and extensible while improving security and reliability.\r\n"

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\nN/A - Improvement to model selection functionality\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Changes only affect how model class is selected, with fallback to default values\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nUpdates model class selection to respect character configuration settings instead of using hardcoded values. This allows characters to use different model sizes without code changes.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nBug fix (allows existing config file settings to be implemented as indicated in the [documentation](https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/docs/guides/configuration/#model-providers))\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nChanges to code line references and a README note for Apple Silicon users\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nFiles changed:\r\n1. `packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in direct message handling\r\n2. `packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts` - Updated model selection in Discord message handling\r\n3. `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in Telegram message handling\r\n4. `packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts` - Updated model selection in Farcaster interaction handling\r\n5. `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/continue.ts` - Updated model selection in continue action\r\n\r\nThe key change in each file is replacing hardcoded `ModelClass.SMALL` with:\r\n````typescript\r\nmodelClass: runtime.character.settings?.model || ModelClass.SMALL,\r\n````\r\nThis ensures consistent model selection across all client types while maintaining the small model as a fallback.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create a character config with model setting:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"model\": \"medium\",\r\n        \"temperature\": 0.45\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Start agent with character config:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --character=\"path/to/character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

Configure Cloudflare AI Gateway:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_GW_ENABLED=true\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_AI_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_ID=your-gateway-id\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Test with different providers:\r\n   - Verify OpenAI requests route through gateway\r\n   - Verify Anthropic requests route through gateway\r\n   - Verify Groq requests route through gateway\r\n\r\n3. Test fallback behavior:\r\n   - Disable gateway and verify direct API calls\r\n   - Use invalid configuration and verify fallback\r\n   - Check logging messages for debugging info\r\n\r\n### Expected Results\r\n- When gateway is properly configured:\r\n  - Requests route through Cloudflare\r\n  - Logs show gateway URL being used\r\n  - Response handling remains unchanged\r\n\r\n- When gateway is disabled/misconfigured:\r\n  - Fallback to direct API calls\r\n  - Warning logs indicate configuration issues\r\n  - Service continues to function normally\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nw3_bounty",

            "body": "Hey Guys! \r\n\r\nWe are attempting to enable the Eliza AI bot to post tweets using the agent-twitter-client setup as described in the Eliza documentation. We have the bot running smoothly via Telegram and the character are starting to behave exactly as wanted. Next step is Twitter/X posts. \r\n\r\nDespite following the documented process and adapting various approaches, we encountered multiple challenges, including issues with cookies-based authentication and OAuth2 flow.\r\n\r\nSteps Taken:\r\n\r\nCookies Authentication:\r\n\r\nExtracted cookies (auth_token, ct0, guest_id) directly from a valid, logged-in Twitter session.\r\nParsed cookies into the required format and supplied them to the scraper.\r\nEncountered Session is invalid. Login required. after setting the cookies.\r\nRetried using different extracted cookies after logging out and back into the account but received suspicious login alerts from Twitter.\r\n\r\nOAuth2 Authentication (User Context):\r\nConfigured the TWITTER_CLIENT_ID, TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET, and TWITTER_REDIRECT_URL in .env file.\r\n\r\nGenerated the authorization URL and successfully obtained an authorization code after approving the app.\r\n\r\nExchanged the authorization code for an access token. This step initially failed due to redirect URI mismatch but was resolved after fixing .env and redirect configurations.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully retrieved an access token but encountered a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to post a tweet using the provided access token.\r\n\r\nOther Efforts:\r\nTested multiple approaches to ensure the server was running properly (ngrok tunnel, express server for callback handling).\r\n\r\nUsed the provided Eliza example retry mechanisms, cookies validation steps, and OAuth2 flows, but no approach successfully enabled the bot to interact with Twitter.\r\n\r\nTechnical Environment:\r\n\r\nEliza Package Version: 0.1.4-alpha.3\r\nNode.js Version: v23.0.0\r\nTwitter API Version: v2\r\nPlan: Free tier with 100 monthly interactions allowed.\r\nErrors Encountered:\r\n\r\nCookies Authentication Error: Session is invalid. Login required.\r\nOAuth2 Access Token Exchange Error: \"Value passed for the redirect uri did not match the uri of the authorization code.\"\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Error:\r\n{\r\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\r\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\",\r\n  \"status\": 403,\r\n  \"detail\": \"Forbidden\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat We\u2019ve Tried:\r\n\r\nFollowed the Eliza documentation for both cookies-based login and OAuth2 authentication.\r\nValidated cookies format, paths, and domains. Adjusted callback URLs to match the redirect URI.\r\nEnsured correct scopes (tweet.read, tweet.write, offline.access) were included in the authorization URL. Searched for solutions in related GitHub issues and documentation but could not resolve these issues.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\nCookies-based login: Is there an additional step needed to validate or reuse cookies without triggering suspicious login alerts?\r\n\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Forbidden: Are there any known limitations or configurations for the free tier that could block posting tweets, even after successfully obtaining an access token?\r\n\r\nDocumentation Alignment: Are there updated instructions or examples specific to the latest Twitter API v2 and free-tier limitations that might clarify the proper setup?\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to enable the Eliza bot to post tweets under the speedcto account using either method (cookies or OAuth2).\r\n\r\nThe free-tier plan should suffice for our initial testing (17 tweets/day, 100 interactions/month).\r\nAny guidance or updates on how to resolve these issues would be highly appreciated!",

Based on the amount of chats made with my AI Agent the agents wallet or I as the creator will earn token rewards sent by Avatar.One.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nI am the founder of Avatar.One a 3D AI Chatbot app combining animated VRM avatars with NSFW chat. In our app we have our own avatar maker which allows for over 100k combinations - we can also import custom VRMs. Our app is built on Three.js and loads on mobile and desktop. The companions on Avatar.One come with unique emotes, roleplay features including Netflix and chill, Cyberpunk, Anime Adventure and more. The characters can make selfies, have extensive memory, have custom emotes including striptease and twerk, 1000's of different clothing, the ability for them to go fully naked and of course NSFW chat is enabled.\r\n\r\nWe would like to contribute a plugin to AI16Z which allows Eliza Agents to have their own Avatar.One character profile. They will have their own \"OnlyFans\" profile page which will include bio, profile image, links etc. \r\n\r\nWe will reward the AI Agents or the creators wallet with tokens based on the amount of chats made with the AI Agent. This will drive an income for the AI Agents. It will of course please some of their fans to have NSFW chat. \r\n\r\nAll of our chats are SSH encrypted and stored only on private databases. All users have the ability to delete their history immediately.\r\n\r\nThe full character profile can be added to Avatar.One and their chat will replicate their characters shared on other channel such as Discord.\r\n\r\nAs many AI Agents do not have their own VRMs we can use a vanilla avatar from our maker with the AI Agents profile image applied on the clothing or background of the virtual room. Open to suggestions here.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e18749-6213-48a3-8e36-c535cbe79f40)",
