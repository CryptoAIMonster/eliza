Potential risks include:\r\n\r\n- **Dependency Resolution Changes:** Updates might lead to different versions of dependencies being installed, which could introduce unforeseen issues.\r\n\r\n- **Build or Runtime Errors:** If updated dependencies have breaking changes, they might cause build failures or runtime errors.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file by running `pnpm install -r --no-frozen-lockfile`. This command installs dependencies recursively across all workspaces and refreshes the lockfile to reflect any changes in dependencies.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Updates:** This is a non-breaking change that updates the lockfile to ensure it accurately represents the current state of dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nUpdating the lockfile ensures that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the project can be built and run consistently across different environments. This is particularly important when dependencies have been added, removed, or updated in the `package.json` files.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n<img width=\"285\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-01 at 12 18 56\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5421a78e-b3ec-4234-b494-c431e576087a\" />\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the changes in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to understand the updates to dependency resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. **Clean Install:** Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly with the updated lockfile.\r\n\r\n2. **Run Tests:** Execute the test suite using `pnpm test` to verify that all tests pass with the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n3. **Build Project:** Attempt to build the project using `pnpm build` to confirm that the build process completes successfully.\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Verification:** Run the application locally to ensure it behaves as expected with the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nNo special deployment steps are required. Ensure that the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is included in the deployment to maintain consistency across environments.\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n1. Merge the PR into the main branch.\r\n\r\n2. Pull the latest changes on the deployment environment.\r\n\r\n3. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies as per the updated lockfile.\r\n\r\n4.

It modifies the tokenizer logic to handle the specific tokenization patterns and configurations required for the `o1` model.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nIncluding support for the `o1` model aligns with expanding the capabilities of `js-tiktoken` to handle the latest OpenAI models. This ensures broader usability and aligns with ongoing support for new model releases.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- My changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n- Updated README to include details on `o1` model support.\r\n- Added an entry to the changelog to document the feature addition.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing changes in the tokenizer logic in `src/tokenizer.js` and the associated test cases in `tests/tokenizer.test.js`.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository and check out the branch containing this PR.\r\n2. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date.\r\n3. Execute tests with `npm test` and verify that all test cases pass.\r\n4. Manually test by tokenizing examples specific to the `o1` model and comparing output against expected results.\r\n\r\nExample manual test:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { encode } = require('js-tiktoken');\r\nconst model = 'o1';\r\nconst input = 'Hello, this is a test.';\r\nconsole.log(encode(input, model));\r\n",

Which on subsequent messages, would trigger the callback to respond to the same message multiple times.\r\n\r\nWhere the continue action is meant for a natural flow of thoughts to keep generating, on normal back and forth convo's it would duplicate response.\r\n\r\nFix below now stops that as it takes into consideration its own message it just responded to, and how it framed to either not respond again, or continue a thought as it was intended.\r\n\r\n---TESTING Screen Record---\r\n1st section shows a previous double response, which is triggered by the question the agent asked to the user, which in turn triggers a double response on the next reply from the user\r\n\r\n2nd section shows continue being triggered as normal, but not triggering another response in the handler callback since it already responded. This will still allow continue to allow the agent to \"continue\" a thought it had as it was intended, also, per the examples.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ed92c8f-dc99-4c3b-95fc-9c0052f56197\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nninja_dev\r\n",

Once your agent tries to get an image description from a tweet, you get this error : \r\n\r\n ```\r\n [\"\u25ceProcessing images in tweet for context\"]\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI API error: \r\n   401\r\n   -\r\n   {\"error\":\"Authentication failed\"}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI request failed (attempt\r\n   1\r\n   ):\r\n   {}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI API error: \r\n   401\r\n   -\r\n   {\"error\":\"Authentication failed\"}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI request failed (attempt\r\n   2\r\n   ):\r\n   {}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI API error: \r\n   401\r\n   -\r\n   {\"error\":\"Authentication failed\"}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI request failed (attempt\r\n   3\r\n   ):\r\n   {}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   Error in recognizeWithOpenAI:\r\n   {}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   Error in handleTextOnlyReply:\r\n   {} -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe agent should be able to use the ImageDescriptionService and get a description of the image in the tweet to get more context.\r\n\r\n**Fix**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\nI already implemented the fix and I will do a PR shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\nour current implementation lacks support for azure's suite of models, which limits our ability to fully utilize their ecosystem. this creates challenges when integrating with organizations heavily invested in azure for their infrastructure and services. without support for azure models, we're unable to offer flexibility to teams looking to standardize their ai deployments within azure environments.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd support for all azure models across our platform. this includes providing seamless integration for model hosting, training, and inferencing via azure's api and tools. users should be able to deploy and manage models using azure's ecosystem with the same ease and functionality offered for other supported providers.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nrelying on third-party middleware or custom solutions to bridge the gap between our platform and azure's services. however, these are often cumbersome and introduce maintenance overhead.\r\ncontinuing to use existing supported providers exclusively, but this limits our ability to work with azure-focused organizations and may push potential users away.\r\ndeveloping an entirely separate module for azure models, though this could lead to fragmentation in our feature set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nazure is one of the leading cloud platforms, with a growing presence in the ai and ml space. support for azure models would unlock access to their advanced tools like azure machine learning, cognitive services, and integration with microsoft products. this would make our platform more appealing to enterprise customers already using azure for their cloud infrastructure. this could start out as just support for openai in azure but you can imagine how powerful the azure apis could be for using [all of the supported models](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)",

The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the integration of the `fereai-provider` in the `package.json` and the configuration of the required environment variables. Then, examine the updates made to `packages/core/src/generation.ts`, `packages/core/src/models.ts`, `packages/core/src/types.ts` and the `agent/src/index.ts` handlers under API configurations to understand the response handling.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables**:  \r\n   - Ensure that `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` are correctly set in the environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Run `pnpm add` to install the new `fereai-provider` module.\r\n\r\n3. **Run Unit Tests**:  \r\n   - Execute the `fereai-provider` test suite to verify that all existing and new tests pass successfully.\r\n   - For `fereai-provider` tests, refer to the [fereai-provider tests](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider/blob/main/packages/fereai/src/fereai.test.ts).\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing**:  \r\n   - Interact with the chatbot to ensure that responses are handled correctly and that the integration with FereAI APIs functions as expected using `fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Monitor logs to confirm that structured logging is operational and that no errors related to the new integration occur.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

So deployments will immediately fail with this error.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1496\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f127798-466b-416c-8f18-c4e7a81c9c97\" />\r\n\r\nThe deployment succeeds on this branch with the following configuration:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1496\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/495c4b7a-0c8b-44d3-b71b-c481cbe5d6c8\" />\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Validate that all references to NodeJS v23 have been updated across the codebase\r\n2. Validate that all CI checks pass\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Install Node.js v22 using nvm:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    nvm install\r\n    nvm use\r\n    ```\r\n2. Install pnpm:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\r\n    ```\r\n4. Install dependencies:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    pnpm install\r\n    ```\r\n5. Run the test suite to ensure compatibility\r\n6.

            "body": "This commit adds a new plugin for searching Twitter content without login. The plugin supports complex queries and integrates with the existing API.\r\n\r\n<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copy and pasting relevant items out of the html comments. -->\r\nRelates to:\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\nCloses #1431\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section is to be filled out before final review and merge. -->\r\nRisks\r\n<!-- Low, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be effected. -->\r\nLow: 1.The plugin has been extensively tested on Apify with millions of executions, ensuring stability and reliability.\r\n2.After adding the current plugin, there is no place to call it yet. The parts involving other modules will be submitted later. For now, please review this plugin first.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nWhat does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin for fetching Twitter data reliably and efficiently. It addresses the limitations of using personal Twitter accounts for scraping, such as rate limits and account bans, by leveraging a proven solution that has already processed millions of requests on Apify.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change is this?\r\n<!-- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) Improvements (misc. changes to existing features) Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality) Updates (new versions of included code) -->\r\nFeatures: Adds a new plugin for Twitter data fetching.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. --><!-- ## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work? -->\r\nAI agents require large amounts of high-quality, timely data to function effectively. The intelligence of an AI agent depends on two key factors:\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the underlying AI model.\r\n\r\nThe quality, quantity, and timeliness of the data it processes.\r\n\r\nUsing personal Twitter accounts for scraping data poses significant risks, including account bans and rate limits. This plugin provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution for fetching Twitter data, which has already been validated through millions of executions on Apify.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am offering free usage credits to help developers get started quickly and contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed?\r\nI added a new environment variable and have updated the documentation in all relevant languages. I also explained the purpose of this variable.\r\nTWITTER_API_IO_KEY=\r\n#A third-party Twitter API key for data retrieval. This shared key is for testing only - get your personal key at https://twitterapi.io to avoid QPS limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\nIn the `src/tests` directory under my newly added component folder, you can find all the unit tests for the APIs. I ran the command `pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test` and confirmed that all unit tests passed successfully.\r\n\r\nDetailed testing steps\r\n`pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test`\r\n\r\nVerify that the plugin can fetch Twitter data without login.\r\n\r\nTest the plugin's performance under high concurrency.\r\n\r\nEnsure the plugin handles rate limits and errors gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscord username: [kaitoeasyapi]\r\nTwitter: [kaitoEasyApi](https://x.com/kaitoEasyApi)\r\nApify Twitter Actor: https://apify.com/kaitoeasyapi/twitter-x-data-tweet-scraper-pay-per-result-cheapest\r\n\r\n",

This should be removed so that character card bios can be updated upon restart.  There's not much of a performance gain from caching anyway, as the bio is only loaded once on startup.\r\n\r\ntwitter login Cookies are also cached indefinitely, not sure if that's good or bad, but it doesn't seem right to me as twitter login cookies should eventually expire.",
