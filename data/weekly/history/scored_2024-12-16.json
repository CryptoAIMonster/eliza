The implementation provides a reusable and scalable solution for caching data in the application by also implementing the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n\r\n**Implemented Features:**\r\n- `getCache`: Retrieves cached data for a given `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `setCache`: Caches data with a unique key constructed using `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `deleteCache`: Removes cached data for the specified `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- Proper error handling and logging for all Redis operations.\r\n- Integration with the `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` interface.\r\n\r\n**Code Highlights:**\r\n- A new `RedisClient` class implements the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n- The `buildKey` method ensures unique Redis keys for each agent and operation.\r\n- `ioredis` is used for efficient Redis interactions, supporting advanced Redis features like clusters and pipelines if needed in the future.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Provides a scalable and reusable caching solution.\r\n- Ensures clear separation of concerns and adheres to the existing interface.\r\n- Improves application performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe implementation has been tested for the following scenarios:\r\n- Successfully setting a cache entry.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that exists.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that does not exist.\r\n- Deleting a cache entry.\r\n- Handling Redis errors gracefully during operations.\r\n",

It utilizes the `actions/labeler` action to apply predefined labels, streamlining the triage process.\r\n\r\n**What kind of change is this?**\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n**Documentation changes needed?**\r\n\r\n- My changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n- I have updated the documentation accordingly to include information about the new labeling workflow and how to configure it.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\n**Where should a reviewer start?**\r\n\r\nReview the `.github/labeler.yml` file for label configurations and the `.github/workflows/labeler.yml` file for the workflow setup.\r\n\r\n**Detailed testing steps**\r\n\r\n1. **Review Configuration Files**:\r\n   - Ensure that `.github/labeler.yml` contains accurate label definitions corresponding to file paths and branch naming conventions.\r\n   - Verify that `.github/workflows/labeler.yml` is correctly configured to trigger on pull request events.\r\n\r\n2. **Create Test Pull Requests**:\r\n   - Submit pull requests that modify files in various directories or branches to test if the appropriate labels are applied automatically.\r\n\r\n3. **Monitor Workflow Execution**:\r\n   - Observe the Actions tab in the repository to confirm that the workflow runs as expected and applies the correct labels.\r\n\r\n4. **Validate Label Application**:\r\n   - Check the pull requests to ensure that the labels applied match the criteria defined in `.github/labeler.yml`.\r\n\r\n5. **Adjust Configurations if Necessary**:\r\n   - Based on testing outcomes, refine the label definitions or workflow settings to achieve the desired labeling behavior.\r\n\r\n**Deployment instructions**\r\n\r\nNo special deployment instructions are required. Once merged, the workflow will be active and apply labels to new pull requests based on the defined criteria.\r\n\r\nBy implementing this automated labeling system, we aim to improve the efficiency of our pull request management process, ensuring that contributions are accurately categorized and reviewed promptly.

The solution should:\r\n\r\nFetch chart data, annotations, and other custom elements from TradingView via API.\r\nFormat the content appropriately for Twitter, including text captions for context and hashtags.\r\nProvide options to schedule or instantly post tweets from TradingView without switching between platforms.\r\nInclude settings for customization, such as default hashtags, watermarking charts, or adding predefined text templates.\r\nDescribe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nManual Process: Manually screenshotting charts and uploading them to Twitter, but this is inefficient and lacks automation.\r\nThird-party Tools: Using standalone apps like TweetDeck or social media managers, but these don't integrate with TradingView's annotations directly.\r\nCustom Scripts: Writing scripts to automate the TradingView-to-Twitter flow, but this requires significant development time and is not as user-friendly as a plugin-based solution.\r\nAdditional context\r\n\r\nTradingView provides an API that can retrieve chart data and render annotations, which can streamline integration.\r\nThe GOAT plugin already has a Twitter API integration, so extending its capabilities to include TradingView should be feasible.\r\nThis feature could significantly enhance the usability of both tools for traders and content creators.\r\nScreenshot or visual example of an ideal tweet with TradingView integration for reference:\r\n(Include a hypothetical example showing how a TradingView chart and description would appear in a tweet.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, our logging for the Coinbase plugin lacks structured formats and essential context, making it challenging to debug issues effectively and trace requests across services.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a structured logging framework that:\n- Uses JSON format for all logs.\n- Includes standard fields such as timestamp, severity, and correlation ID.\n- Supports context injection for better observability.\n- Has different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).\n- Allows adding custom fields relevant to the Coinbase plugin operations.\n\nFor example, using a logging framework like Winston in Node.js:\n```javascript\nconst logger = require('winston');\nlogger.info('User login attempt', { userId: '12345', correlationId: 'abc-123' });\n```\nThis will greatly assist in correlating events and debugging any issues that may arise.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Relying on plain text logs, which can be cumbersome to parse and analyze.\n- Using manual JSON formatting, which is error-prone.\n- Implementing APM tools without a standardized logging approach.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nEnhancing our logging practices will lead to better monitoring, easier log aggregation, and a more consistent logging pattern, ultimately improving our overall observability and debugging capabilities.",

Make the AgenRuntime constructor private and create a static factory function that is async and accepts `ReadonlyArray<Plugin | DynamicPlugin>` as a parameter. Await the dynamic parameters in the async static factory. Bonus points for adding `_tag: 'Plugin'` and `_tag: 'DynamicPlugin` to the respective types, although this would be a high impact change since it would fuck over downstream plugins."

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\n1. Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241222%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241222T094432Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=1a5dd5544d9787bd4b80ce1fa9db82a9647389b7df93cfd2c0c41a3d7400e4b9)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n \r\n# Detailed testing steps\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE.\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAt _packages/core/src/generate.ts_ When the `imageModelProvider` did not match `modelProvider`, the code iteratively checked for API keys in a fallback chain. It stopped at the first available key (e.g., FAL_API_KEY), even if it belonged to the wrong provider. As a result, the selected API key could be incorrect (e.g., returning and using a key from FAL instead key from Venice).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Set imageModelProvider to VENICE in the character configuration.\r\n2. Provide both FAL_API_KEY and VENICE_API_KEY in .env(or any other relevant key combination).\r\n3. When requesting an image generation observe that the code selects FAL_API_KEY instead of VENICE_API_KEY.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf a specific imageModelProvider is set, the code should return the matching API key for that provider if it exists. If no specific provider key is found, the code should then try the fallback chain in sequence.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c086855-48b3-42ba-b410-6f87c2513711)\r\n\r\n**Fix** \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c59fae1b-652c-41e1-9540-fa2c2a85cba7)\r\n\r\n`const apiKey =\r\n    runtime.imageModelProvider === runtime.modelProvider\r\n        ? runtime.token\r\n        : (() => {\r\n            // First try to match the specific provider\r\n            switch (runtime.imageModelProvider) {\r\n                case ModelProviderName.HEURIST:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.TOGETHER:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.FAL:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.OPENAI:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.VENICE:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n                default:\r\n                    // If no specific match, try the fallback chain\r\n                    return (runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n            }\r\n        })();`\r\n\r\nThis fix updates the logic to first attempt to retrieve the API key from the specifically selected imageModelProvider. If that is not present, it will proceed down the fallback chain. This ensures that if an an image model api key is set, it is correctly chosen over other existing keys which are higher in the selection list, like FAL_API_KEY.\r\n\r\nPS: Solution is implemented and tested, creating bug report for tracked pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Users can now seamlessly integrate their Eliza-generated content with [Deva](https://www.deva.me/), enhancing their content distribution and engagement strategies.\r\n\r\n### What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Feature**: This is a non-breaking change that adds new functionality to the Eliza AI agent by integrating with Deva\u2019s API for posting and scheduling content.\r\n\r\n## Documentation Changes Needed?\r\n\r\nNot at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Create a Deva Account**\r\n    - Navigate to [deva.me](https://www.deva.me/), create an account, and press the \"Get Started\" button in the top right.\r\n    - ![Get Started](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a31ebe01-3ee7-40f5-8e30-f59c79c642fe)\r\n\r\n2. **Complete Onboarding**\r\n    - Click through the onboarding screens and connect your preferred social account (e.g., Twitter) to Deva.\r\n\r\n3. **Access the Deva Feed**\r\n    - You can now see the Deva feed, where you can post and interact with other Devas.\r\n    - <img width=\"1462\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63a95b6e-779a-4864-b37c-5a848bde4c52\" />\r\n\r\n4. **Create an Application to get the token**\r\n    - At this point, you'll be able to get a token to interact with Deva, to do so: \r\n        - Navigate to Apps chapter in settings by clicking the user icon in top right corner and then settings -> Apps, or opening [apps](https://www.deva.me/settings/apps)\r\n        - Press Apps and Session\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fda36ac-3675-4f30-8c48-9b91e71a741e)\r\n        - Press Create new app\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fc9b04-510e-4a90-876c-e4f6d2e562d7)\r\n        - You are redirected to the form of the app creation, Name, Redirect URL and descriptions are necessary fields. Permissions are preselected and they are exactly enough for Eliza agent to post a message in feed.\r\n        - After creating an app, select it from the list of apps;\r\n        - Inside you will find a Get Token button, to generate a new token for your app:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/307ab088-0508-496e-bc8e-4ded833e8b4f)\r\n        - Later, it'll be visible in the list:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39034c0d-3cf3-4a69-aaab-8cd1740d9ba6)\r\n\r\n5. **Update Environment Variables**\r\n    - Once you have the token, update the environment variables in the `.env` file:\r\n      ```env\r\n      DEVA_API_KEY=YourApiKey\r\n      DEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.deva.me # Production API URL\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n6. **Select Deva Client as Default Character**\r\n    - Select the Deva client as Eliza's default character and choose the desired model:\r\n      <br/>![Select Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1120ebb4-4618-4364-bbf8-7040b6bda8c0)\r\n\r\n7. **Run the Application**\r\n    - Execute the following commands to install dependencies and start the application:\r\n      ```bash\r\n      pnpm install && pnpm start\r\n      ```\r\n    - This will initiate the Deva client:\r\n      <br/>![Initiate Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef64f0b-c2c1-4a4b-a6b5-0461433af022)\r\n    - Fetch the persona associated with your agent and the posts that you have pushed to the Deva feed:\r\n      <br/>![Fetch Persona and Posts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a698b06-b616-47cc-8318-355a91cc424c)\r\n    - Once done, Eliza will post one message to the Deva feed immediately and schedule another one as a test message:\r\n      <br/>![Post Messages](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523d69f4-1f3f-4d49-82a1-163e3cd4d128)\r\n8. **Eliza agent's post is in the feed!**\r\n   - <img width=\"621\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bd7cd5-7e3a-4c64-9597-9b0909642189\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### Staging Environment Testing\r\n\r\nTo avoid populating the production Deva feed, you can perform the same flow in the [staging environment](https://staging.deva.me/). Ensure you update the related environment variable:\r\n\r\n```env\r\nDEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api-staging.deva.me # Staging API URL\r\n",

In the future, I'll be adding more custom abstract-only functionality which is why I did not re-use the existing zksync logic.\r\n\r\nI've overhauled the transfer functionality so ERC20 and ETH transfers are properly working as seen below:\r\n<img width=\"590\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 4 21 28\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/616b0d52-0d2d-4fb2-8c99-503a3cbc40ec\" />\r\n<img width=\"593\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 4 47 22\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bd005e9-2c1e-4822-8d98-533f866ee3aa\" />\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, I will add Abstract specific documentation\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nSpin up an agent with the abstract plugin\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

Trump says silly offensive stuff, and we wanted to capture that. He would not say SARS-COVID-19. I disagree with about 99% of the stuff he says, and 99% of the stuff his character file says. That being said, I care about art, and not letting art be compromised by politics.\r\n\r\nWe love people all over the world, and personally I will be visiting China in a couple days to meet everyone. I don't believe that we should be against any group for their nationality. But we shouldn't kill the comedy and make our characters worse-- that's why OpenAI's models suck now. It's a slippery slope that will reduce bravery, integrity and quality."

            "body": "_sup fam, today i put in a few hours to extend the Eliza framework by adding some core trading functionality for on-chain solana bots. my focus was to create a set of tools that will allow agents to execute trades, manage risk, and pull critical data. here's what I added and worked on:_\r\n\r\n**What I Added/Completed Today:**\r\n\r\n1. nice_funcs.py:\r\n\r\n- Added a library of helpful functions tailored for Solana on-chain trading.\r\n- Functions now include position management, wallet holdings fetching, and other utilities to make trading more efficient.\r\n- This has been tested with my personal bots but should integrate well with Eliza\u2019s architecture.\r\n\r\n2. bot.py:\r\n\r\n- Built a script that allows agents to perform trading actions such as:\r\n- Closing a position (action 0).\r\n- Opening a position (action 1).\r\n- Adding stop-loss logic (action 2).\r\n- Implementing breakout trades (action 3).\r\n- Market-making logic (action 5).\r\n- Currently, it uses basic user input to decide the action, but this will soon be fully bot-driven.\r\n\r\n3. get_ohlcv_data.py\r\n\r\n- this allows the agent to get open, high, low, close and volume data\r\n- also have moving averages and examples of other technical indicators\r\n\r\n4. dontshare.py (ignored):\r\n\r\n- Added placeholders for sensitive information such as:\r\n- Solana private keys.\r\n- BirdEye API keys.\r\n- RPC URLs.\r\n- Added this file to .gitignore to ensure it doesn\u2019t get accidentally pushed.\r\n\r\n5. Updated README.md:\r\n\r\n- Wrote a comprehensive README to document how to use these new tools and scripts.\r\n- It includes detailed steps for configuration, usage, and what each action/script does.\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Why This Matters:**\r\n\r\n- These tools lay the groundwork for enabling AI agents to perform advanced trading strategies directly on-chain.\r\n- The added functionality simplifies interaction with Solana contracts while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.\r\n- It ensures agents can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention\u2014just plug in the strategy, and they're good to go.\r\n\r\n**What's Next?**\r\n\r\n- I'm researching the best way to transition from Python to TypeScript or add a shell for TS compatibility, depending on the project direction.\r\n- Planning to integrate more trading actions like:\r\n- Funding buys (action 6).\r\n- Liquidation monitoring (action 7).\r\n- Always happy to hear feedback on how this integrates with Eliza\u2019s current architecture and if there are specific improvements to focus on.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity to contribute. Let me know if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to adjust or refine for tomorrow.",

Any stored references or comparisons to old UUIDs will no longer match.\r\n\r\n### Risks & Impact\r\n\r\n- **Risk**: Existing code/data relying on old UUIDs may break or create duplicates.\r\n- **Mitigation**: We can choose to:\r\n    1. Merge only the **tests** for now, keeping the existing UUID generation.\r\n    2. Merge the bit fix (and re-key), but accept the breaking change or plan a migration.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\n1. **(Option A)** Merge only the tests and skip the version-bit fix for now (to avoid re-keying).\r\n2. **(Option B)** Merge both tests and fix, but coordinate any needed data migration or accept re-keying.",

This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. \n\n### Details\nI have exploited this vulnerability in a Windows service using version 5.22.11 of the module, to escalate privileges (in an environment where I am authorized to do so). However, as far as I can see from the code, it is still present in master branch at time of writing, on line [403/404 of network.js](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/blob/3a92931c7d46605ffddc1aacb97a9727273b2888/lib/network.js#L403).\n\nThe SSID is obtained from `netsh wlan show interface ...` in `getWindowsWirelessIfaceSSID`, and then passed to `cmd.exe /d /s /c \"netsh wlan show profiles ...` in `getWindowsIEEE8021x`, without sanitization.\n\n### PoC\nFirst, the command injection payload should be included in the connected Wi-Fi SSID. For example create hotspot on mobile phone or other laptop, set SSID to payload, connect to it with victim Windows system. Two example SSID's to demonstrate exploitation are below.\n\nDemonstration to run ping command indefinitely:\n```\na\" | ping /t 127.0.0.1 &\n```\n\nRun executable with privileges of the user in which vulnerable function is executed. Chosen executable should should be placed in (assuming system drive is C): `C:\\a\\a.exe`.\n```\na\" | %SystemDrive%\\a\\a.exe &\n```\n\nThen, the vulnerable function can be executed on the victim system, for example, using:\n```\nconst si = require('systeminformation');\nsi.networkInterfaces((net) => { console.log(net) });\n```\n\nNow the chosen command, `PING.exe` or `a.exe` will be run through the cmd.exe command line.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>sebhildebrandt/systeminformation (systeminformation)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.23.8`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n### [`v5.23.6`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone UTC, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

You can STILL keep all your keys directly in .env, but if you specify \"SECRET_NAMES\" in your .env, it will pull secrets through that from AWS along with anything in the .env\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Create an AWS account. Free-tier is enough. \r\n2. In Secrets Manager, create a secret named \"secret/myagentname\" (this can be named anything but this format is nice). \r\n3. Add in all the keys you have in your .env currently as key value pairs in this secret and save.\r\n\r\n### IAM Role Setup:\r\nFirst, create an IAM Policy:\r\n\r\nGo to AWS Console \u2192 IAM \u2192 Policies \u2192 Create Policy\r\nSelect JSON and use this policy document:\r\n\r\njsonCopy{\r\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\r\n    \"Statement\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n            \"Action\": [\r\n                \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\r\n                \"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Resource\": [\r\n                \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:secret:*\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nName it something like \"SecretsManagerReadAccess\"\r\n\r\n### Create the IAM Role:\r\n\r\nGo to IAM \u2192 Roles \u2192 Create Role\r\nChoose your use case:\r\n\r\nFor EC2: Select \"AWS service\" and \"EC2\"\r\nFor Lambda: Select \"AWS service\" and \"Lambda\"\r\nFor other services: Choose appropriate trust relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nAttach the policy you just created (\"SecretsManagerReadAccess\")\r\nName the role (e.g., \"SecretsManagerRole\")\r\n\r\n\r\n### Get the Role ARN:\r\n\r\nAfter creating the role, click into it\r\nCopy the \"Role ARN\" from the summary section\r\nIt will look like: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SecretsManagerRole\r\nThis is what you'll put in your .env file as AWS_ROLE_ARN\r\n\r\n\r\n### If you're using this with EC2:\r\n\r\nAttach this role to your EC2 instance\r\nGo to EC2 \u2192 Select instance \u2192 Actions \u2192 Security \u2192 Modify IAM Role\r\nSelect the role you created\r\n\r\n\r\n### For local development:\r\n\r\nYou'll need AWS credentials configured locally\r\nUse aws configure with credentials that can assume this role\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your new ENV could look like this:\r\nAWS_REGION=us-east-1\r\nSECRET_NAMES=secret/ropAIrito\r\nAWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::[REPLACE WITH YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER WITHOUT THE BRACKETS]:role/secrets-access-role \r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT TO NOTE**: You can use the .env just how it has normally been used in the Eliza repo. This is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nSecurity change / cleanup / ease of use\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nJust think it is more secure to pull from secrets manager, especially if people are hosting their agent on AWS, but this will work even if you host elsewhere as long as you have the a service role with secrets manager access specified in the \"AWS_ROLE_ARN\".\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMaybe just an explainer that Secrets Manager is useable with Eliza.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb09a61-fb4e-457a-8209-9eb7e6d53eca)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ddcd2b7-8fce-4e0c-8c90-a25af4ce5d3f)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a286a34-b560-4adb-b633-acb6a1209969)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd96be74-4966-41a2-babc-7e4c625bdbbe)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/166014ea-9185-4bb0-b2d7-433c5ac50e25)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nTake a look at settings.ts in the core package. \r\n\r\n### Discord Username\r\n\r\nropirito",

In `.env`, should set the value for `TREASURE_ADDRESS` (public address for the agent account), `TREASURE_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key for the same account), and `TREASURE_RPC_URL` as https://rpc.treasure.lol.\r\nTo test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. [Treasure Bridge](https://bridge.treasure.lol/) can be used to bridge MAGIC directly from `arb1` to an address on `treasure`.\r\n2. Run the agent and prompt it with: \"Send 0.1 MAGIC to \" - e.g. \"send 0.1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\"\r\n3. Assuming you had 1 MAGIC to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. \"Successfully sent 1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\r\nTransaction: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Treasure Block Explorer (https://treasurescan.io/)",

            "body": "## Description\r\nWhile setting up Discord bots with multiple characters, I encountered and resolved an issue with Discord token resolution. This could be valuable documentation for other developers.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe Discord client was failing with the following error:\r\n```\r\nError [TokenInvalid]: An invalid token was provided.\r\n    at WebSocketManager.connect (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/websocket/WebSocketManager.js:136:26)\r\n    at Client.login (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/Client.js:228:21)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was happening even though the tokens were correctly set in the `.env` file. The issue was in how the tokens were being resolved from environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI fixed this by:\r\n\r\n1. Ensuring proper token resolution in `eliza/packages/client-discord/src/index.ts`:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Get the token using runtime's getSecret\r\nconst token = this.character?.settings?.secrets?.DISCORD_API_TOKEN;\r\n\r\n// If it's a variable reference (${...}), resolve it from environment\r\nif (token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}')) {\r\n    const envVarName = token.slice(2, -1);\r\n    this.apiToken = process.env[envVarName] || '';\r\n} else {\r\n    this.apiToken = token || '';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Adding debug logging to track token resolution:\r\n```typescript\r\nelizaLogger.debug('Token resolution debug:', {\r\n    characterName: this.character.name,\r\n    rawToken: token,\r\n    isEnvVar: token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}'),\r\n    envVarName: token?.startsWith('${') ? token.slice(2, -1) : null,\r\n    envValue: token?.startsWith('${') ? process.env[token.slice(2, -1)] : null\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Points\r\n1. Character files should reference environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"secrets\": {\r\n            \"DISCORD_API_TOKEN\": \"${DISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE}\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `.env` file should contain the actual tokens:\r\n```env\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE=actual_token_here\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JUAN=actual_token_here\r\n```\r\n(where Julie and Juan are agents names)\r\n\r\n3. The token resolution process:\r\n   - First checks character's settings.secrets\r\n   - If the value is a variable reference (${...}), resolves it from environment\r\n   - Otherwise uses the raw value\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTo verify the fix:\r\n1. Ensure tokens are correctly set in `.env`\r\n2. Run the bot with both characters:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --characters=\"characters/julie.character.json,characters/juan.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n3. Check debug logs for token resolution process \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI suggest:\r\n1. Adding this documentation to the main repository\r\n2. Possibly including it in the official docs under a \"Troubleshooting\" or \"Configuration\" section\r\n3. Adding debug logs to help other developers diagnose similar issues\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like me to create a PR with these changes. ",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen defining a `twitterShouldRespondTemplate` in a character\u2019s JSON configuration file, the code attempts to invoke it as a function with `(validTargetUsersStr)`. Since JSON cannot store JavaScript functions, this causes runtime errors. Other templates like `twitterMessageHandlerTemplate` and `twitterPostTemplate` are handled purely as strings, so they work fine. The inconsistency leads to broken response generation when a JSON-defined `twitterShouldRespondTemplate` is present.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. **Create a character JSON file** (e.g., `adam.character.json`) that includes:\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"your-character-name\",\r\n        \"clients\": [\"telegram\", \"twitter\"],\r\n        \"modelProvider\": \"openai\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"secrets\": {\r\n                \"TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\": \"your_telegram_bot_token\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_USERNAME\": \"user\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_EMAIL\": \"email@proton.me\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_PASSWORD\": \"your_twitter_password\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_COOKIES\": \"[{\\\"key\\\":\\\"auth_token\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_auth_token\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"ct0\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_ct0_value\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"guest_id\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"v1%3A173451270913595996\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}]\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\": \"user1,user2\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        \"plugins\": [\r\n            \"@ai16z/plugin-your-custom-plugin\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"templates\": {\r\n            \"twitterPostTemplate\": \"# Areas of Expertise\\n{{knowledge}}\\n\\n# About {{agentName}} (@{{twitterUserName}}):\\n{{bio}}\\n{{lore}}\\n{{topics}}\\n\\n{{providers}}\\n\\n{{characterPostExamples}}\\n\\n{{postDirections}}\\n\\n# Task: Generate a post in the voice and style and perspective of {{agentName}} @{{twitterUserName}}.\\nWrite a 1-3 sentence post that is {{adjective}} about {{topic}} (without mentioning {{topic}} directly), from the perspective of {{agentName}}.
