The main risks are:\r\n\r\n- Rate limiting from CoinMarketCap API (Stricter limits compared to CoinGecko)\r\n- Potential timeout issues when the API is slow\r\n- Invalid cryptocurrency symbols causing failed requests\r\n- Cost implications as CoinMarketCap API is a paid service\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- Adds a new CoinMarketCap plugin for cryptocurrency price checking\r\n- Implements a `GET_PRICE` action that fetches current prices using the v1 API\r\n- Provides TypeScript types and interfaces for CoinMarketCap API responses\r\n- Includes environment validation for API key configuration\r\n- Adds proper error handling for API calls and symbol validation\r\n\r\n### What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality):\r\n\r\n- New plugin implementation\r\n- New paid API integration\r\n- New TypeScript types and validation\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n\r\n- Add CoinMarketCap plugin setup instructions\r\n- Document required API key configuration\r\n- Add usage examples for price checking\r\n- Update plugin list in main documentation\r\n- Add pricing/rate limit considerations\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the plugin implementation in `/plugin-coinmarketcap/src/`\r\n2. Check the main action implementation in `index.ts`\r\n3. Verify API service in `service.ts`\r\n4. Review type definitions in `types.ts`\r\n5. Check template handling in `template.ts`\r\n\r\n### Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Set up environment:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run agent locally and test natural language queries:\r\n   - \"What's the current price of Bitcoin?\"\r\n   - \"Show me ETH price in USD\"\r\n   - \"Get the price of SOL\"\r\n\r\n3. Verify error handling:\r\n   - Try with invalid symbols\r\n   - Test API timeout scenarios\r\n   - Check rate limit handling\r\n   - Verify currency conversion handling\r\n\r\n## Future Expansion\r\n\r\n### 1. Extended CoinMarketCap Integration\r\n\r\n- Add support for all available cryptocurrencies\r\n- Include market data (market cap, volume, supply)\r\n- Add historical price data\r\n- Support multiple currency conversions\r\n- Implement proper rate limit handling\r\n\r\n### 2. Additional API Features\r\n\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/map` - Add support for symbol/id mapping\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/info` - Include detailed crypto metadata\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/listings/latest` - Add market data sorting and filtering\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/categories` - Support category-based queries\r\n- `/global-metrics/quotes/latest` - Add global market metrics\r\n\r\n### 3. Enhanced Features\r\n\r\n- Price alerts configuration\r\n- Multi-currency price comparisons\r\n- Historical data analysis\r\n- Price change tracking\r\n- Market data aggregation\r\n- Advanced symbol resolution\r\n- Improved error messaging\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n0xspit",

Review the plugin implementation in `/plugin-coingecko/src/`\r\n2. Check the main action implementation in `getPrice.ts`\r\n3. Verify environment validation in `environment.ts`\r\n4. Review type definitions in `types.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Set up environment:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_api_key\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run agent locally and test natural language queries:\r\n   - \"What's the current price of Bitcoin?\"\r\n   - \"Show me ETH price in EUR\"\r\n   - \"How much is USDC worth?\"\r\n   - \"Get the price of Solana\"\r\n\r\n3. Verify error handling:\r\n   - Try with invalid coin names\r\n   - Test API timeout scenarios\r\n   - Check rate limit handling\r\n\r\n# Future Expansion\r\n1. Extended CoinGecko Integration:\r\n   - Support all coins listed on CoinGecko (currently ~10,000+ cryptocurrencies)\r\n   - Add coin metadata (market cap, volume, supply)\r\n   - Include historical price data and charts\r\n   - Support multiple currency conversions in a single query\r\n\r\n2. Additional API Features:\r\n   - `/simple/supported_vs_currencies` - Add support for all available fiat currencies\r\n   - `/coins/markets` - Include detailed market data\r\n   - `/coins/{id}/tickers` - Add exchange-specific price data\r\n   - `/coins/{id}/market_chart` - Support price charts and historical analysis\r\n   - `/global` - Add global crypto market metrics\r\n   - `/search` - Implement fuzzy search for coin names\r\n   - `/exchange_rates` - Support BTC-to-fiat conversion rates\r\n   - `/trending` - Add trending coins information\r\n\r\n3. Enhanced Features:\r\n   - Price alerts and notifications\r\n   - Price comparison across multiple coins\r\n   - Custom time range for historical data\r\n   - Price change percentage tracking\r\n   - Market sentiment analysis\r\n   - Portfolio tracking capabilities\r\n\r\n# Discord username\r\n0xspit",

    "body": "\r\n\r\n# Localhost Handling: Windows vs macOS\r\n\r\n## Windows Behavior\r\n1. Network Stack\r\n- Defaults to IPv6 (::1) when resolving `localhost`\r\n- More strict separation between localhost and IP address bindings\r\n- Requires explicit permissions for network interface bindings\r\n- More complex security model with Windows Firewall\r\n\r\n2. Access Control\r\n- Stricter access control policies\r\n- Requires explicit configuration to allow applications to bind to all interfaces\r\n- May require administrator privileges for certain network operations\r\n- Different handling for IPv4 and IPv6 connections\r\n\r\n3. Common Issues\r\n- EACCES errors when binding to ports\r\n- Permission problems with localhost access\r\n- IPv4/IPv6 conflicts in network applications\r\n- Needs explicit host configuration in development servers\r\n\r\n## macOS Behavior\r\n1. Network Stack\r\n- Unified handling of `localhost` resolution\r\n- Seamless integration between IPv4 and IPv6\r\n- More permissive default network interface bindings\r\n- Simplified security model\r\n\r\n2. Access Control\r\n- More lenient default permissions\r\n- Automatic handling of localhost-to-IP routing\r\n- Better integration between different network interfaces\r\n- Less restrictive port binding policies\r\n\r\n3. Advantages\r\n- \"It just works\" approach to localhost\r\n- Better default security without sacrificing developer experience\r\n- More consistent behavior across different network configurations\r\n- Less configuration needed for development environments\r\n\r\n## Development Impact\r\nThis is why development servers like Vite require different configurations:\r\n- Windows needs `host: true` to allow IP access\r\n- macOS works without special configuration\r\n- Windows often needs explicit IP addresses (127.0.0.1)\r\n- macOS handles localhost resolution more intelligently",

    "title": "Fix/PostgreSQL Vector Embedding Validation (#1687)",
    "body": "# PR: PostgreSQL Vector Embedding Validation (#1687)\r\n\r\n## Problem Statement\r\nThe PostgreSQL adapter was missing critical vector embedding validation:\r\n\r\n1. **Vector Embedding Issues**:\r\n   - Missing validation for vector dimensions (should be 1536 for OpenAI)\r\n   - No proper validation of vector data types\r\n   - Inconsistent error handling for vector operations\r\n   - Lack of comprehensive testing for vector operations\r\n\r\n## Solution Overview\r\n\r\n### Vector Embedding Validation\r\n\r\n#### Core Changes in `index.ts`\r\n1. New `validateVectorSetup` function:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   private async validateVectorSetup(): Promise<boolean> {\r\n       try {\r\n           const vectorExt = await this.query(`\r\n               SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector'\r\n           `);\r\n           const hasVector = vectorExt.rows.length > 0;\r\n           \r\n           if (!hasVector) {\r\n               elizaLogger.error(\"Vector extension not found in database\");\r\n               return false;\r\n           }\r\n           \r\n           return true;\r\n       } catch (error) {\r\n           elizaLogger.error(\"Failed to validate vector extension:\", {\r\n               error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)\r\n           });\r\n           return false;\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Enhanced `init()` method:\r\n   - Added vector validation during initialization\r\n   - Improved schema application logic\r\n   - Better error handling for vector operations\r\n   - Proper dimension validation (1536)\r\n\r\n## Testing Infrastructure\r\n\r\n### New Test Suite\r\nLocated in `src/__tests__/`:\r\n\r\n1. `vector-extension.test.ts`:\r\n   - Schema management tests\r\n   - Memory operations with vector tests\r\n   - Error handling and validation tests\r\n\r\n2. `docker-compose.test.yml`:\r\n   ```yaml\r\n   version: '3.8'\r\n   services:\r\n     postgres-test:\r\n       image: pgvector/pgvector:pg16\r\n       environment:\r\n         POSTGRES_DB: eliza_test\r\n         POSTGRES_USER: postgres\r\n         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\r\n       ports:\r\n         - \"5433:5432\"\r\n       healthcheck:\r\n         test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"pg_isready\"]\r\n         interval: 10s\r\n         timeout: 5s\r\n         retries: 5\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. `run_tests.sh` - Automated test environment\r\n4. `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation\r\n\r\n## Test Results\r\n\r\n### Vector Extension Tests\r\n```\r\n✓ Schema and Extension Management (4/4)\r\n  ✓ should initialize with vector extension\r\n  ✓ should handle missing rooms table\r\n  ✓ should not reapply schema when everything exists\r\n  ✓ should handle transaction rollback on error\r\n\r\n✓ Memory Operations with Vector (3/3)\r\n  ✓ should create and retrieve memory with vector embedding\r\n  ✓ should search memories by embedding\r\n  ✓ should handle invalid embedding dimensions\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Environment Details\r\n- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector\r\n- Test database: eliza_test\r\n- Port: 5433 (isolated)\r\n- Vector dimensions: 1536 (OpenAI standard)\r\n\r\n## Key Improvements\r\n\r\n1. **Vector Validation**:\r\n   - Proper dimension verification (1536)\r\n   - Extension presence checks\r\n   - Clear error messages\r\n   - Robust validation logic\r\n\r\n2. **Testing Infrastructure**:\r\n   - Automated test environment\r\n   - Comprehensive test coverage\r\n   - Isolated testing setup\r\n   - Vector-specific test cases\r\n\r\n3. **Documentation**:\r\n   - Setup instructions\r\n   - Testing procedures\r\n   - Troubleshooting guide\r\n   - Vector operation examples\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- Resolves #1687\r\n- Ensures correct vector dimensions\r\n- Prevents invalid vector operations\r\n- Provides comprehensive testing\r\n- Improves error handling and logging\r\n- Better developer experience with clear error messages\r\n\r\n## Required Environment\r\n- PostgreSQL 16+\r\n- pgvector extension\r\n- Docker for testing\r\n- Node.js and pnpm\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n- Implementation validates vector dimensions properly\r\n- All tests passing successfully\r\n- Proper error handling for vector operations\r\n- Comprehensive test coverage for vector functionality\r\n- Clear error messages for debugging\r\n",

    "title": "fix(postgres): Handle vector extension creation properly (#1561)",
    "body": "# PR: Fix PostgreSQL Vector Extension Issues (#1561)\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe PostgreSQL adapter was encountering a \"type vector does not exist\" error when trying to create tables that use the `vector` type. This was happening because:\r\n1. The `vector` extension was being created in the `extensions` schema\r\n2. The `vector` type wasn't accessible in the `public` schema where tables were being created\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nWe implemented a robust fix that:\r\n1. Creates the `extensions` schema if it doesn't exist\r\n2. Properly handles the `vector` extension creation in the `extensions` schema\r\n3. Adds the `extensions` schema to the search path before table creation\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n```sql\r\n-- Create extensions schema first\r\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS extensions;\r\n\r\nDO $$\r\nBEGIN\r\n    IF NOT EXISTS (\r\n        SELECT 1\r\n        FROM pg_extension\r\n        WHERE extname = 'vector'\r\n    ) THEN\r\n        CREATE EXTENSION vector\r\n        SCHEMA extensions;\r\n    END IF;\r\nEND $$;\r\n\r\n-- Add extensions schema to search path\r\nSET search_path TO public, extensions;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing and Verification\r\n### Test Environment\r\n- Docker container using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image\r\n- Clean PostgreSQL instance with pgvector support\r\n- Database: `eliza_test`\r\n\r\n### Test Scenarios\r\n\r\n1. **Initial Installation Test**\r\n   - ✅ Schema creation successful\r\n   - ✅ Vector extension created without errors\r\n   - ✅ All tables created with correct vector type\r\n   - ✅ All indexes created successfully\r\n   - ✅ Transaction committed successfully\r\n\r\n2. **Idempotency Test (Second Run)**\r\n   - ✅ No duplicate key errors\r\n   - ✅ Proper handling of existing objects with NOTICE messages\r\n   - ✅ Vector extension checks working correctly\r\n   - ✅ Transaction committed successfully\r\n\r\n### Test Results\r\n```sql\r\n-- First Run Output\r\nCREATE SCHEMA\r\nDO\r\nCREATE EXTENSION\r\nSET\r\n[... tables and indexes created successfully ...]\r\nCOMMIT\r\n\r\n-- Second Run Output\r\nNOTICE: schema \"extensions\" already exists, skipping\r\nCREATE SCHEMA\r\nDO\r\n[... proper \"already exists\" notices ...]\r\nCOMMIT\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nThis fix:\r\n- Resolves issue #1561\r\n- Prevents duplicate extension creation errors\r\n- Maintains proper schema organization\r\n- Ensures vector operations work correctly across schemas\r\n- Provides idempotent schema creation\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n- The solution follows PostgreSQL best practices for extension management\r\n- Schema search path is explicitly set to ensure type availability\r\n- Implementation is idempotent and safe to run multiple times\r\n- Tested with pgvector-enabled PostgreSQL instance\r\n- No changes required to application code\r\n\r\n## Required Environment\r\n- PostgreSQL 15 or later\r\n- pgvector extension must be available (e.g., using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image)\r\n- Proper permissions to create schemas and extensions\r\n",

The current multi-page approach requires extra navigation steps to switch between agents. This redesign aims to simplify the experience by making it easier to switch between conversations while maintaining context.\r\n\r\n- Removes the multi-page routing structure in favor of a single-page chat interface\r\n- Implements a collapsible sidebar containing agent selection\r\n- Adds a chat-like interface with agent header and message thread\r\n- Integrates theme toggle into the new sidebar\r\n- Adds avatar generation for agents using DiceBear\r\n- Improves overall UI/UX with modern chat application patterns\r\n\r\n## Questions to Consider\r\n1. Is chat the primary interaction mode we want to focus on?\r\n2. Is there a specific planned feature roadmap for `client` app?\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Start with `client/src/Agents.tsx` to review the new main layout structure\r\n2. Review `client/src/Chat.tsx` to see the simplified chat component\r\n3. Check the router changes in `client/src/router.tsx`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Launch the application and verify the new sidebar layout appears\r\n2. Test sidebar collapse/expand functionality\r\n3. Select different agents and verify chat history remains isolated\r\n4. Test theme toggle in the new sidebar location\r\n5. Verify message sending/receiving still works as expected\r\n6. Test responsive design at various screen sizes\r\n7. Verify avatar generation for each agent\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![eliza_chat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0035a547-8721-4fee-8b50-b16283c31a0b)\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nStandard deployment - no special steps required.\r\n",

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow. \r\n- The caching mechanism in the wallet provider is isolated and uses a short TTL (5 seconds), which minimizes the impact on operations.\r\n- Changes to the transfer action align with existing types and state management, with no breaking changes expected.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces improvements and fixes to the EVM plugin:\r\n1. **Caching in Wallet Provider**: Implements a caching mechanism to store wallet balances for 5 seconds, reducing redundant calls and improving performance.\r\n2. **Align Transfer Action**: Removes unnecessary `template` field from the transfer action, aligning it with its intended type and improving clarity.\r\n3. **State Update on Transfers**: Enhances state updates by populating the state with recent messages for better transfer context.\r\n4. **Improved Transfer Template**: Refines the transfer template for valid JSON responses and clearer placeholders.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Features**: \r\n  - Added caching to the WalletProvider to reduce redundant operations.\r\n  - Improved transfer template for better JSON response handling.\r\n- **Performance**: \r\n  - Enhanced state updates in the transfer action for improved context handling.\r\n- **Bug Fixes**: \r\n  - Aligned transfer action to its intended type, removing unnecessary fields.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n- To improve the performance and maintainability of the EVM plugin that we use in production.\r\n- To ensure the transfer action operates in line with its intended functionality, reducing the risk of errors.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review changes in the wallet provider (`WalletProvider`) for caching logic.\r\n2. Examine the updated transfer action implementation to verify type alignment and state updates.\r\n3. Test the improved transfer template to ensure JSON responses are valid and placeholders function correctly.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Run unit tests for the wallet provider to verify caching functionality.\r\n2. Test the transfer action manually by asking an agent for a transfer and checking:\r\n   - Correct state updates.\r\n   - Valid and cached wallet balance in the state.\r\n   - Successful transaction.\r\n3. Verify the cache expiry behavior by observing multiple wallet balance fetches within and outside the 5-second TTL.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNo specific deploy instructions needed; automated tests and regular deployment process suffice.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n**nikita_zhou**\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Agent interaction\r\n\r\nLink to the tx: https://testnet.iotexscan.io/tx/f946fce5bc127761bd780444bf2d3180bf66fa4944b37e803767e99e76dd0d13\r\n\r\n<img width=\"755\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 12 25 34 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c765432-ced8-4944-b543-aa6dbc99d2c3\" />\r\n\r\n### Caching\r\n\r\n<img width=\"610\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 12 26 43 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfc17094-02d0-4b09-ba30-2018501d6277\" />\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n\r\n<img width=\"899\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-02 at 10 31 25 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb011bf-d84d-4550-99ef-4212b341265b\" />\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1122\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-02 at 10 20 39 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af098dac-2e22-4b0e-b6a1-540d8e8ebe9a\" />\r\n",

    "title": "Opacity Verifiable Interference zkTLS Plugin",
    "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n[Cloudflare's AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) provides logs for all prompt request responses , which are the target of the mpc-tls , ensuring that all AVS validators are performing MPC-TLS on the same date. \r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nBy writing the proof to `proof.json`, you can also verify using \r\n```sh\r\ncurl --location 'https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify' \\\r\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n--data @proof.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis invokes a shared mpc-tls session as listed in step 7. \r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

    "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, we observed issues with aixbt, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Reclaim as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Reclaim is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nUpdates \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating **Reclaim** as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zero-knowledge proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-reclaim README.\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Proof Verification Example\r\nBelow is a screenshot showcasing the generated proof and its verification process:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 39 17 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c64b01-47b1-4ece-8624-9b65e7624f66\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 31 20 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41d675e-9249-4c46-9f12-396f02b7d8b2\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure the following environment variables (generated from the [Reclaim Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)):\r\n```\r\n# Reclaim Protocol\r\nRECLAIM_APP_ID= # Reclaim App ID\r\nRECLAIM_APP_SECRET= # Reclaim App Secret\r\n\r\n# Verifiable Inference Configuration\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_ENABLED=true # Set to true to enable verifiable inference\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=reclaim # Options: reclaim, opacity (soon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run a character using the command:\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"`\r\n\r\n3. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n4. Interact with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- Automated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n- No database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n--> Gajesh#0000\r\n",

    "body": "# 🤖 Bitcoin for AI Agents\r\n\r\nThis PR enables Eliza agents to handle Bitcoin transactions autonomously through [@arklabs/wallet-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arklabs/wallet-sdk) integration. Agents can now receive payments for services, pay other agents, and manage their Bitcoin wallets with both on-chain and Layer 2 (Ark protocol) support.\r\n\r\n### 🚨 WARNING\r\n\r\nCaution: Until an external audit is completed, it is strongly recommended not to use this integration on the main Bitcoin network with more than a negligible amount of BTC.\r\n\r\n## 🔑 Configuration\r\n\r\nThe plugin requires the following environment variables:\r\n\r\n```env\r\n# Required\r\nBITCOIN_PRIVATE_KEY=           # Your Bitcoin private key in WIF format\r\nBITCOIN_NETWORK=              # Network type: bitcoin, testnet, regtest, signet, or mutinynet\r\n\r\n# Optional - for Ark L2 support\r\nARK_SERVER_URL=              # Ark protocol server URL\r\nARK_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY=       # Ark server public key for L2 operations\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🚀 Available Actions\r\n1. SHOW_BITCOIN_ADDRESSES\r\n```ts\r\n// Get both on-chain and off-chain addresses\r\nconst addresses = await runtime.triggerAction(\"SHOW_BITCOIN_ADDRESSES\");\r\n// Returns: { onchain: \"bc1...\", offchain: \"ark1...\" }\r\n```\r\n2. BALANCE\r\n```ts\r\n// Check wallet balance with USD conversion\r\nconst balance = await runtime.triggerAction(\"BALANCE\");\r\n// Returns formatted balance with on-chain/off-chain breakdown and USD values\r\n```\r\n3. COINS\r\n```ts\r\n// List available UTXOs (both on-chain and virtual)\r\nconst coins = await runtime.triggerAction(\"COINS\");\r\n// Returns detailed UTXO information\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. SEND_BITCOIN\r\n```ts\r\n// Send Bitcoin with various denomination options\r\nawait runtime.triggerAction(\"SEND_BITCOIN\", {\r\n  recipient: \"bc1...\",\r\n  amount: \"0.001\",           // BTC amount\r\n  amountUSD: \"100\",         // USD amount (alternative)\r\n  amountSats: \"100000\"      // Satoshi amount (alternative)\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔍 Key Benefits for Agents\r\n\r\n1. **Autonomous Financial Operations**\r\n   - Agents can receive payments for API calls, content generation, or other services\r\n   - Automated payment processing for inter-agent service exchanges\r\n   - Self-managed wallet with balance monitoring\r\n\r\n2. **Flexible Payment Options**\r\n   - Support for both on-chain and Layer 2 transactions\r\n   - USD-denominated transactions with automatic conversion\r\n   - Real-time price awareness for fee estimation\r\n\r\n3. **Enhanced Security**\r\n   - Private key management through environment variables\r\n   - Support for Taproot addresses (P2TR)\r\n   - Optional Layer 2 integration for lower fees and faster transactions\r\n\r\n## 📋 Implementation Status\r\n\r\n- [x] Core Bitcoin functionality\r\n- [x] Ark protocol L2 integration\r\n- [x] USD denomination support\r\n- [x] BIP21 URI support\r\n- [ ] Silent Payments support (coming soon)\r\n- [ ] External security audit\r\n- [ ] Complete documentation\r\n\r\n## 🧪 Testing\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd packages/plugin-bitcoin\r\npnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 📚 Example Usage\r\n\r\nHere's how to integrate the Bitcoin plugin into your agent:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { bitcoinPlugin } from \"@elizaos/plugin-bitcoin\";\r\n\r\nconst character = {\r\n  // ... other character config\r\n  plugins: [bitcoinPlugin],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Basic Transaction Flow\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// 1. Check balance\r\nconst balance = await runtime.triggerAction(\"balance\");\r\nconsole.log(\"Current balance:\", balance);\r\n\r\n// 2. List available UTXOs\r\nconst coins = await runtime.triggerAction(\"coins\");\r\nconsole.log(\"Available coins:\", coins);\r\n\r\n// 3. Send payment\r\nawait runtime.triggerAction(\"SEND_BITCOIN\", {\r\n  recipient: \"bc1...\",\r\n  amountUSD: \"50\", // Send $50 worth of BTC\r\n});\r\n```",

    "title": "feat: Twitter Spaces Integration",
    "body": "# Risks\r\nLow. Existing users who relied on Deepgram by default will still see no change unless they explicitly define a new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`. Fallback logic preserves original behavior (Deepgram → OpenAI → Local).\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- **Adds** an optional `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` setting (`deepgram`, `openai`, or `local`) with fallback logic.  \r\n  - If not set, old behavior remains: Deepgram → OpenAI → Local.\r\n- **Moves** Twitter Spaces plugins from `agent-twitter-client` into this repo for better flexibility and less friction in plugin development.\r\n- **Introduces** an AI-driven Twitter Spaces flow:\r\n  1. **Automatic** Space launch decisions (random chance, business hours, cooldown intervals).\r\n  2. **Multi-speaker** logic with queue management (`maxSpeakers`).\r\n  3. GPT-based filler/idle messages, optional STT/TTS bridging, local audio recording.\r\n  4. Graceful shutdown and cooldown for repeated Spaces.\r\n\r\n### Transcription Service Changes\r\n- We introduced a new **`TranscriptionProvider` enum** (`Deepgram`, `OpenAI`, or `Local`) to replace string flags.\r\n- In `initialize()`, the **provider is chosen in this order**:\r\n  1. `character.settings.transcription` (if the API keys exist),\r\n  2. `.env` (`TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`),\r\n  3. Old fallback logic (Deepgram → OpenAI → Local) if neither is configured.\r\n- For example, in your `character.json`, you can specify:\r\n  ```json5\r\n  {\r\n    // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n      \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  If you have `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set, the service will use Deepgram; otherwise it continues to the next check.\r\n- `processQueue()` uses a `switch` on `this.transcriptionProvider` to pick the final method (`transcribeWithDeepgram`, `transcribeWithOpenAI`, or `transcribeLocally`).\r\n\r\n## Flow Recap\r\n1. **Periodic Check**  \r\n   - If no Space is running, possibly launch one by `shouldLaunchSpace()` (random chance, business hours, cooldown).  \r\n   - If a Space is running, `manageCurrentSpace()` handles speaker timeouts, occupancy updates, queue acceptance, etc.\r\n\r\n2. **Space Creation**  \r\n   - Generates a `SpaceConfig` (topics from config or GPT).  \r\n   - Attaches plugins: audio recording, STT/TTS, idle monitor, etc.  \r\n   - Hooks into `speakerRequest`, `occupancyUpdate`, `idleTimeout`, etc.\r\n\r\n3. **Speaker Logic**  \r\n   - Maintains an `activeSpeakers` array + a queue if at capacity (`maxSpeakers`).  \r\n   - Enforces `speakerMaxDurationMs` per speaker.  \r\n   - If a speaker is removed, accept next in queue if available.\r\n\r\n4. **Stopping**  \r\n   - `stopSpace()` finalizes the Space, logs completion, clears states, etc.  \r\n   - Resumes periodic checks at a slower interval until the next launch is decided.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### A) `.env` / Environment Variables\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Transcription Provider\r\nTRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=         # Default is local (possible values: deepgram, openai, local)\r\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\r\nDEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### B) `character.json` → `\"twitterSpaces\"` Field\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n  }\r\n  \"twitterSpaces\": {\r\n    \"maxSpeakers\": 2,\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"Blockchain Trends\",\r\n      \"AI Innovations\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"typicalDurationMinutes\": 45,\r\n    \"idleKickTimeoutMs\": 300000,\r\n    \"minIntervalBetweenSpacesMinutes\": 60,\r\n    \"businessHoursOnly\": true,\r\n    \"randomChance\": 0.3,\r\n    \"enableIdleMonitor\": true,\r\n    \"enableSttTts\": true,\r\n    \"enableRecording\": false,\r\n    \"voiceId\": \"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\",\r\n    \"sttLanguage\": \"en\",\r\n    \"gptModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\r\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful AI co-host assistant.\",\r\n    \"speakerMaxDurationMs\": 240000\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **`maxSpeakers`**: number of concurrent speakers allowed.\r\n- **`topics`**: if none are provided, GPT generates them dynamically.\r\n- **`randomChance`**: probability for each check cycle to spawn a new Space.\r\n- **`speakerMaxDurationMs`**: maximum time each speaker can speak before removal.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Features** (new Twitter Spaces integration and optional transcription provider).\r\n- **Improvements** (unified plugin development, more config options, fallback logic maintained).\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, minimal. We must mention:\r\n- The new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (optional).\r\n- The new `twitterSpaces` config section in `character.json`.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Check `transcription.service.ts` to review how it resolves conflicts by prioritizing character settings, then `.env`, then old fallback.\r\n- Check new or relocated Twitter Spaces integration files for the Space lifecycle (launch, speaker management, idle detection, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Define `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (or leave it empty to keep old fallback).\r\n2. Provide valid API keys if choosing `deepgram` or `openai`.\r\n3. Define `twitterSpaces.randomChance` in the character JSON to `1` (for a 100% rate of starting a space).\r\n4. Run the agent; verify that Spaces launch automatically, respect the chosen transcription provider, and handle multi-speaker logic as expected.\r\n\r\nNo special database migrations are needed. Basic local runs and logs confirm correct functioning.\r\n\r\n# Future Improvements\r\n\r\n- **More robust decision logic** for accepting speakers, switching, and timeouts.  \r\n- **Realtime API plugin** for smoother, on-the-fly conversation handling.  \r\n- **Solo Broadcast Mode**: launch Spaces focused on a single host monologue with no external speakers.  \r\n- **True VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** to detect when a speaker finishes talking, instead of relying on manual mute/unmute cues.  \r\n- **Advanced scheduling triggers** (e.g., event-based or calendar-based).  \r\n- **Analytics & insights** for post-Space summaries or usage metrics.\r\n\r\n---",

Previously the code strongly implied that the MemoryManager would act on different tables in the underlying DB, whereas all instantiations of the MemoryManager actually write to the same table in the DB but write a string to the 'type' field to distinguish (and namespace) different types of memories.  This PR renames 'tableName' as 'memoryType' \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nCode improvement\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?

I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.  I know there is alot of interest in the memory system as well so as part of the core it should be as clear as possible IMHO."

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nNo\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n**Low**\r\n- Adjustments to database queries improve performance by moving sorting and limiting logic to the database side.\r\n- Even though this change adds improvements to the Postgres adapter and required a change in the global `IDatabaseAdapter`, other database adapters are still working because the `limit` parameter is optional.\r\n- Other plugins relying on the `getMemoriesByRoomIds` function can opt into the `limit` functionality, but it is not necessary.\r\n- No breaking changes introduced.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR improves the performance of memory-fetching functionality by:\r\n- Moving sorting and slicing logic from the application layer to the database layer.\r\n- Adding an optional `limit` parameter to restrict the number of results fetched from the database.\r\n- Adjusting the runtime logic to leverage the new database query functionality.\r\n\r\n## Why was this change made?\r\nIn our database with **60,000 memories**, fetching memories by room IDs took **40 seconds**, significantly affecting the performance of the agent. After applying this fix, the query execution time dropped to just **0.02 seconds**. This improvement was observed using Supabase analytics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Changes to existing functionality to improve database query performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts` to understand how sorting and limiting were implemented in the database query.\r\n- Look at the adjusted runtime logic in `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` for the integration of the `limit` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1.

    "body": "<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copy and pasting relevant items out of the html comments. -->\r\n\r\n# Relates to: \r\n[[Bounty] #1221 feat: Eliza Dev Code Assistant default characterfile](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1221)\r\n\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section is to be filled out before final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow: mostly self contained (high modularity, low coupling), does require minor update to `core/src/knowledge.ts` to enable feature of bypassing knowledge search (used when searching online first, then adding that to knowledge).\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8. Please let me know if anything is broke when you test it, it worked well on my end.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Shaiw Talks like Shaw\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/241b9420-8a6c-4115-ba73-7438bba91156)\r\n\r\n### Casual Conversation\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2b4a44-da93-4c80-902d-284222855811)\r\n\r\n### More\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adbf96ba-6f0b-4f58-8714-2fbc048b962e)\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nCaution: the docs site is crawled and inserted into vectordb on launch, each time you load the agent, this will happen. During testing, I suggest using cleanstart startup script, to wipe the database.  In production, this will need to be managed through db, if new pages are loaded.  This may need fixed in future to make this easier to manage.\r\n\r\n<!--  Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n## Database changes\r\nNeed to change from sqlite, to the database you use in test/production.\r\n\r\n<!--  If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n## Discord username\r\naah8098 (Allen)\r\n",

The image description is too long because it uses the full prompt as the caption. This exceeds the character limit for Telegram image captions, sometimes resulting in an caption too long error. And the caption of the image seems not correct\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1189\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-27 at 9 01 29 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82fae8d5-09f8-4da7-8384-952701ed9f3b\" />\r\n\r\n"

Perhaps we could enhance this PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1220 by including functionality to quote the user’s message for image replies. However, it seems this PR primarily focuses on improving the image generation plugin prompt. It might be a good idea to adjust the title to better reflect the scope of the changes."
