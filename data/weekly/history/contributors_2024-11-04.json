This relates to this issue: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/206\r\n\r\nIf you add overrides to your character file, it will use these templates in place of the templates that are in the code. Obviously how the templates work and what they are is opaque, and will require looking into the code for them. Fortunately, the template variable names are the same as the overrides.\r\n\r\nWe should add documentation and some kind of tutorial / explanation of templates and how to modify them, but for now lets get this in so our partners can use it.",

So when clicking this, I was not expecting to see setup instructions. It seems like this is mostly duplicate info from the \"[Getting Started](https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/docs/quickstart/)\" section. There isn't really an API, so I'd suggest we just remove this section for now.\n* Possibly replace with with some documentation about how the core information flows from the Agent Runtime, to the Memory System, the Room-based Organization, Information Processing Pipeline, Provider Integration, and State Management - though these could all be valid sections under the Advanced Concepts section as well on the Documentation page.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c6d401-9b6b-4f49-90f7-528ffb4acefb)\n*  banner image is broken\n",

Check the Groq implementation in `core/src/core/generation.ts`\r\n2. Review the model configuration for Groq\r\n3. Test text generation using Groq provider\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Set up environment with Groq API key\r\n2. Configure character to use ModelProvider.GROQ\r\n3. Test text generation:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst runtime = new AgentRuntime({\r\n  modelProvider: ModelProvider.GROQ,\r\n  // other config...\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst response = await generateText({\r\n  runtime,\r\n  context: \"Test prompt\",\r\n  modelClass: \"SMALL\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n4. Verify response format matches other providers\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Initialized Groq client with API key\r\n- Configured model parameters for Groq provider\r\n- Added ModelProvider.GROQ enum value\r\n\r\nThe implementation follows the same pattern as the other providers",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe `getCachedEmbeddings` for the sqlite adapter is flawed with the recent [introduction of vec_distance_L2](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/commit/e96764a53c1d15b6f53cff6ec842f63f70d13842). \r\n\r\n```\r\npackages/adapter-sqlite/src/index.ts:226\r\nconst memories = this.db.prepare(sql).all(opts.query_table_name, new Float32Array(opts.query_input.split(\",\").map(Number)), // Convert string to Float32Array\r\n                                              ^\r\nRangeError: Too few parameter values were provided\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The sql query expects 5 values, but only 4 are passed. `query_match_count` should be used for `LIMIT`\r\n2. The creation of the float array seems off. The `query_input` does not include any comma separated values. The resulting array is `[NaN]`\r\n3. Distance comparison is between a float array and a string. It should probably be compared to `query_threshold`, not `query_input`\r\n\r\nRelated function is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/15f7ba88d04d9d7d1cf0f608762fa84da06cb313/packages/adapter-sqlite/src/index.ts#L332C11-L360\r\n\r\nI'm happy to contribute if someone can guide me. I have little clue about `vec_distance` and didn't manage to infer what the intention of the change was exactly.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"characters/custom.character.json\"` and type something\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nNo sqlite errors\r\n",
