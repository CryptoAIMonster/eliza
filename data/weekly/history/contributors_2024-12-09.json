This will also enable autonomous agent to unify all input and outputs into a single stream of thought and action.\r\n\r\n* Unified agent wallet\r\nThe current wallet system reflects the way we use humans use wallets today, but the UX around network switching and wallet management is a pain. Instead, the agent will have a unified wallet, with access to all registered chains at once. No wallet switching, and tokens will all be handled by agents in a unified way.\r\n\r\n* CLI Tool\r\nWe want a create-react-app like experience for creating new projects, and we want CLI handlers for adding and removing plugins, opening chat interface in browser, maybe even deploying like Cloudflare Wrangler to some of our deployment provider friends. Should also handle secrets management and character / agent / conversation management.\r\n\r\n* Model Provider Registry\r\nThe current model provider system requires a pull request to core for every model provider. v2 will have a registry and override pattern so new code doesn't need to be added to core, and any provider can quickly override with a few lines of code to add integration without a pull request.\r\n\r\n* Extensible and generic core framework\r\nThe v1 is very opinionated about prompts, state and some features. v2 will be very extensible so you can create different kinds of agents and override state management and context composition. For advanced developers, this will make the framework far more powerful and flexible for different user cases.\r\n\r\n* Community plugins\r\nWe'll be moving community plugins out of core and adding requirements for plugin inclusion in core around test coverage, documentation and code maintenance and ownership.\r\n\r\n* Better secret management\r\nCurrently, secret management in .env and character files is risky, so considering better and more secure options for this\r\n\r\n* 100% Test Coverage\r\nv2 reflects what we want Eliza to be, and we feel that after these changes we should focus entirely on stability, security and cutting down on issues. We'll be aiming for 100% test coverage of core, adapters and primary components, and end-to-end tests for clients.",

Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache\n2. npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces\n3. installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation)\n\nThis can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B\n\nUsers generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it).\n\nHere, that expectation is broken\n\n### Details\n\nSee PoC.\n\nIn it, overrides from a single run of A get leaked into e.g. `~/Library/Caches/pnpm/metadata/registry.npmjs.org/rimraf.json` and persistently affect all other projects using the cache\n\n### PoC\n\nPostinstall code used in PoC is benign and can be inspected in <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ponyhooves?activeTab=code>, it's just a `console.log`\n\n1. Remove store and cache\n   On mac: `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/pnpm ~/Library/pnpm/store`\n   This step is not required in general, but we'll be using a popular package for PoC that's likely cached\n2. Create `A/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"A\",\n     \"pnpm\": { \"overrides\": { \"rimraf>glob\": \"npm:ponyhooves@1\" } },\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i --ignore-scripts` (the flag is not required, but the point of the demo is to show that it doesn't help)\n4. Create `B/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"B\",\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i`\n\nResult:\n```console\nPackages: +3\n+++\nProgress: resolved 3, reused 3, downloaded 0, added 3, done\nnode_modules/.pnpm/ponyhooves@1.0.1/node_modules/ponyhooves: Running postinstall script, done in 51ms\n\ndependencies:\n+ rimraf 6.0.1\n\nDone in 1.4s\n```\n\nAlso, that code got leaked into another project and it's lockfile now! \n\n### Impact\n\nGlobal state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs\n\nAs a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pnpm/pnpm

There is a risk of potential issues if the frozen lock file is not respected, which could lead to inconsistent dependency versions across environments.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the installation commands across various files to ensure that the `pnpm install` command uses the `--frozen-lockfile` option. This prevents the lock file from being incorrectly updated during installations. Additionally, an explicit update script has been added to allow updates without the frozen lock file option. We updated the .npmrc default to set frozen-lockfile=true and in order to update the lockfile when you add a new dependency in your package.json or bump a version in your package.json you need to explicitly call pnpm i --no-frozen-lockfile \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Improvements**: This change improves the dependency management process by enforcing the use of a consistent lock file during installations.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

See this branch: [jure/fix-workflows-and-docs](https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/tree/jure/fix-workflows-and-docs). I even went so far to try to update Chinese etc. READMEs, which is of course complete nonsense since I don't even understand what is written there. Furthermore, there are scripts that use `pnpm install` that I cannot really test, and since it they are undocumented it's impossible to tell if they should be changed or not.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had a thought to update all references to `pnpm install`, but I changed my mind because it's not a black/white decision. People need to understand how lockfiles work, and if they are not using them properly it is not our ability (or responsibility) to educate them. The issues we're seeing today with lockfiles are the result of (1) `npm` / `pnpm`'s design decision (or rather, a change of), and (2) carelesness.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution therefore boils down to PR reviewers. In particular:\r\n- The `main` and `develop` branches should always be \"stable\", i.e. having passing tests\r\n- Whenever a PR introduces a change that causes tests to fail, it should not be merged until the cause of failure is established and corrected.\r\n\r\nThat said, the tests can fail for more than lockfile being out of sync, and we should probably focus on making them work in a reliable way. One of key issues is that our tests depend on external things such as OpenAI and API keys. I would recommend adding a separate smoke test just for OpenAI (a simple `curl` command)."

This behavior can cause unexpected issues when deploying or running the application, as the installed packages may not match the versions specified in the lock file.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository.\r\n2. Run the command `pnpm install` without the `--frozen-lockfile` option.\r\n3. Observe that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is updated with new versions of dependencies, even if they are not specified in the `package.json`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe `pnpm install` command should respect the `--frozen-lockfile` option, preventing any updates to the lock file. This ensures that the installed dependencies match the versions specified in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, maintaining consistency across different environments.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue was addressed in a recent commit that added the `--frozen-lockfile` option to various installation commands in the project, including in the GitHub workflows, Dockerfile, and scripts. The explicit update script was also introduced to allow updates without the frozen lock file option, ensuring that developers can manage dependencies more effectively without risking unintended changes to the lock file.",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, maintaining comprehensive JSDoc documentation across our TypeScript codebase is a manual and time-consuming process. This leads to inconsistent documentation coverage and puts an unnecessary burden on developers. We need an automated solution that can help generate and maintain JSDoc comments while ensuring high quality and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nPropose a two-phase approach:\r\n\r\n1. Manual Documentation Phase:\r\n   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript files\r\n   - Include documentation for functions, classes, interfaces, and other code blocks\r\n\r\n2. Automation Implementation:\r\n   - Develop an LLM-based automation solution for generating JSDoc comments\r\n   - Integrate the automation into our CI/CD pipeline (like when a PR for a new feat is merged)\r\n   - Create a manual trigger mechanism for the automation process\r\n\r\n**Create a GitHub Actions workflow/AI agent that:**\r\n\r\n1. Automated Documentation Generation:\r\n   - Triggers on demand (via workflow_dispatch) or when specific files change\r\n   - Scans TypeScript files that lack JSDoc documentation\r\n   - Uses an AI service (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate contextually accurate JSDoc comments\r\n   - Maintains existing JSDoc comments and only adds missing ones\r\n\r\n2. Quality Control:\r\n   - Follows our existing JSDoc standards and TypeDoc configuration\r\n   - Validates generated comments for completeness and accuracy\r\n   - Ensures proper documentation of parameters, return types, and function descriptions\r\n\r\n3. Pull Request Management:\r\n   - Creates a new branch for documentation updates\r\n   - Generates a pull request with the changes\r\n   - Adds appropriate labels (e.g., 'documentation', 'automated')\r\n   - Includes a detailed PR description explaining the changes\r\n   - Assigns relevant reviewers\r\n\r\n4. Configuration:\r\n   - Allows customization of AI prompt templates\r\n   - Provides options to include/exclude specific files or directories\r\n   - Configurable commit message and PR templates\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Manual documentation enforcement through PR checks\r\n2. Using existing JSDoc generation tools like https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc\r\n3. Implementing stricter code review policies for documentation\r\n4. Creating documentation sprints for batch updates\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRequired Permissions and Secrets:\r\n- GitHub token with PR creation permissions\r\n- AI service API key (e.g., OpenAI)\r\n- Repository write access for branch creation\r\n\r\n### Additional Motivation\r\n\r\nThis could be a proof of concept AI junior dev Karpathy talks about\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c3c68f-d85a-414c-a26f-231bd6ecb831)\r\n\r\n",

In the `docs/community/` section there's a bunch of summaries based on various discord channels. Me and @odilitime are working on automating this process. Overall though, love the bot idea.

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nFor our use case at Phala Network, we are building a base template docker image for developers to deploy their agents to our TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) Cloud. However, we want to make the loading of the character json file easier to add via a command line argument vs building a new docker image with the new character file. Our main pain point is we want the user journey for technical to non-technical users to be able to publish their character configuration file to a storage protocol like arweave, ipfs, aws, etc. and be able to load those character files in through a command argument. This will make our deploy service easier with a docker compose file that can list the file id location in an argument like `pnpm start --characterUrl=https://characterfile.url`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe developer journey would go as follows:\r\n- Generate a character JSON file through any means (keep this step unopinionated)\r\n- Publish the character file to a storage service. (Ex. Use Thirdweb to post and pin to IPFS https://972b74063c2cd00df1a4cf777bf37d0a.ipfscdn.io/ipfs/bafybeicod5xghpshbxmfb3sh2ccfbb5657dgvxthgwolb42srz4a5iadwm/)\r\n- Create a new CLI argument to the `pnpm start` command named `--characterUrl` that will take in the URL where the character file is hosted\r\n- When the agent is being initialized, `fetch` the character file from the URL and allow for the agent to go through the natural process of starting up the agent\r\n\r\nCode changes should be minimal and would not affect any core functionality so the risk is low.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatives were building a web app similar to vvaifu, but this would not be a good user experience for cloud deployments or a good strategy to compete with them since we are focused on different problems.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis will help bring more users to Eliza with better security and privacy guarantees by utilizing TEE for safe Eliza agent cloud deployments.\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nExample deployment with a mock docker compose file in the TEE Cloud.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0bec2d0-aa0e-418c-bf88-67e37edf1a17)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Added multichain support, the current version of the plugin only supported mainnet and Base, and there have been several requests for additional EVM chain support.\r\n\r\n- The plugin lacked test coverage, so we initiated tests alongside the feature development, starting with WalletProvider.\r\n- Refactored the plugin to make it more test-friendly and modular.\r\n- Added multichain support (for viem chains)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Improvements: Refactoring, cleaning, and testing of the existing plugin.\r\n- Fixes: fix transfer action\r\n- Features: Non-breaking changes to add EVM multichain support. The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup. No changes are required at this time.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## How was it tested\r\n\r\n- Ran test scripts \r\n- Verified functionality through agent interactions:\r\n<img width=\"709\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 5 58 35\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afde079e-7eaa-47cd-89df-60a93f895cd3\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nFile: packages/plugin-evm/src/tests/wallet.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nTry to add your own chain in the character and ask the agent to send some tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou",

Using different formatting like \"For example:\" or \"(example:)\" but \"Example:\" is cleaner\r\n4. Using a bullet point for the example, but numbered lists better show the relationship between the instruction and its example\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis change aligns with our documentation styleguide and makes the contribution guidelines more consistent and professional. It's a small change that improves readability and maintains our documentation standards.\r\n",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe project currently lacks Hebrew (RTL) language support in its documentation. While there are translations for several other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, etc.), Hebrew-speaking users cannot read the documentation in their native language. This is particularly important because Hebrew requires special RTL (Right-to-Left) formatting considerations.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Hebrew (RTL) translation of the main README.md as README_HE.md, including:  \r\n\r\n - Full translation of all sections including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines  \r\n - Proper RTL formatting using HTML/CSS directives\r\n - Addition of Hebrew (\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\nMaintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) - inadequate because it doesn't handle RTL formatting properly and translations are often inaccurate\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nHebrew is spoken by approximately 9 million people globally\r\n\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format)\r\n\r\nSpecial attention should be paid to RTL formatting using <div align=\"rtl\"> tags to ensure proper text direction\r\n\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Hebrew-speaking developer community",

It is necessary to ensure that they are not leaked through workflows being run on behalf of malicious pull requests. In addition to restrictions on running CI/CD workflows we recommend setting up a quota on those keys, and rotating them periodically.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n1. This PR adds two basic tests:\r\n- smoke tests: checks that the project can be built and run\r\n- \"Hello Trump\": checks that the project can use one of the built-in characters (Trump) to successfully query a LLM (OpenAI).\r\n\r\nThe \"Hello Trump\" test requires OpenAI API keys to run. If the API keys are not available, this test will be skipped.\r\n\r\n2. This PR also adds initial (proof of concept) version of integration testing framework. We plan to continue development of this framework in the future as will be adding more integration tests.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThe goal of these tests is to establish a quality gate that every PR should pass at a minimum. We recommend that the tests are run at least:\r\n- on every PR before merging it\r\n- every time the main/stable branch is updated\r\n\r\nAs a policy, merges to main/stable branch should not be allowed if they would break the tests.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nThe included file `tests/README.md` describes the procedure how to set the tests up in a CI/CD environment. The API keys should be set up the repository settings under \"secrets\". When present, they will automatically be added to the .env file for the duration of the workflow.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nThis PR adds a workflow file `integrationTests.yaml` with two jobs. The reviewer should:\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3. Check output of jobs for any errors.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3. Check output of jobs for any errors.\r\n4. Adjust workflow rules to trigger workflows as desired (on pull request, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nuser98634\r\n",

If documentation references the Twitter search or model providers, a brief note should be added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review `packages/client-twitter/src/index.ts` and `packages/client-twitter/src/search.ts` to see changes in the Twitter search logic.\r\n- Review `packages/core/src/models.ts` to confirm the addition of the image model for the Galadriel provider.\r\n- Check `docs/docs/guides` and `docs/quickstart.md` for any changes that may need follow-up documentation edits.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Pull down the changes locally.\r\n2. Run the application with the updated code.\r\n3. Verify that the Twitter client no longer starts the search client by default (reducing rate limit concerns).\r\n4. Confirm that the Galadriel image model is listed and accessible as expected.\r\n5. Review logs and behavior to ensure no errors are introduced by the changes.\r\n\r\nNo special UI changes, so no screenshots required.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nDiscord username: `vi0000`\r\n",

Any context or related work?\r\nThis client allows agents to post to Lens, a social graph that is permissionless and provides a more onchain environment for agents, with a variety of monetization options including collectable posts and open actions.\r\n\r\nThis client is similar to the latest Farcaster client and serves as a base for other devs to include more Lens functionality.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nA few `.env` variables are needed \r\n- get an evm wallet private key\r\n- get a lens profile owned by the same wallet: https://onboarding.lens.xyz/mint\r\n- get ipfs api credentials: https://storj.dev/dcs/api/storj-ipfs-pinning\r\n\r\n```\r\n# client-lens\r\nEVM_PRIVATE_KEY=\r\nLENS_PROFILE_ID=\r\nSTORJ_API_USERNAME=\r\nSTORJ_API_PASSWORD=\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `defaultCharacter.ts` - add the new client to the `clients` array\r\n```\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [],\r\n    clients: [Clients.LENS],\r\n    modelProvider: ModelProviderName.GROK,\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. set new `.env` variables\r\n2. add client to character file\r\n3. start the server\r\n4. agent fetches timeline to generate a new post, and fetches mentions to generate comments\r\n5. if agent creates a post, check it at `https://hey.xyz/u/{agentHandle}`\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n`imthatcarlos`\r\n",

A\r\nmain .gitignore file has already been created at the root level, which\r\ncontains all the necessary exclusions, including those for .ts files.

I'd like to improve the `state` to also take into account memories and previous messages so that the user can have a conversation with the agent, instead of having to pass all the information on one message. The thing is that when I've passed the whole `state` I got answers that were really related to the personality of the `character`, and I got answers that refused to help like \"I'm not here to do that\". \r\nHow can I incorporate the `state`'s memory without the personality of the `character` to gather the parameters for my `action`?"

            "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a plugin that makes Eliza verifiable through the use of TEEs. The plugin leverages the [Marlin Oyster](https://docs.marlin.org/user-guides/oyster/) platform and [SDKs](https://github.com/marlinprotocol/oyster-monorepo). More concretely, it adds an action that lets Eliza respond with remote attestations when asked. It is expected to be followed up with additional PRs for other aspects as well.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nIt's important for AI agents to be verifiable in Web3 so users can verify behaviors and responses of an agent they are interacting with. A performant way of accomplishing this is running the agent in a TEE and providing remote attestation infrastructure for verification by users. Additionally, TEEs provide privacy protections to users' interactions with agents.\r\n\r\nIt is similar in spirit to `plugin-tee` but targets the Marlin Oyster stack instead.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes. A section on the plugin has been added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nThe README of the plugin. It specifies the `.env` settings as well as how to run a mock attestation server for local testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Run the mock attestation server, simplest way is docker - `docker run --init --rm -p 1350:1350 marlinorg/attestation-server-custom-mock`\r\n2. Set configs corresponding to the plugin, just `TEE_MARLIN=yes` should suffice.\r\n3. Chat with Eliza and ask for a remote attestation, I have tried various phrasings like \"attest yourself\", \"get me a remote attestation\", etc which seem to work.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n`roshanroshan`",

Considered trying the cookies from a logged in browser, but it uses the x.com domain, and when you try to add those, startup complains about the wrong domain. Login works, posting works, it just seems that the cookies should work to not trigger new logins each time. Guessing at some point Twitter will flag continuous logins like this. If I don't add cookies at all, same thing, it works, but triggers a login alert email each time.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSimply starting Eliza with Twitter credentials added + manual cookies. They do get cached in the db, but on restart, it still doesn't consider itself logged in and I get an email.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nStay logged in. Don't trigger a new login email alert from Twitter.\r\n",

Added core ERC-20 functionality:\r\n   - Added ERC-20 ABI and contract interactions\r\n   - Implemented token balance checking\r\n   - Added support for token transfers\r\n\r\n2. Implemented new actions:\r\n   - `getBalance`: Check ETH/token balances across chains\r\n   - `transfer`: Native token and ERC-20 transfers\r\n   - Enhanced `bridge`: Cross-chain token bridging via LiFi\r\n   - Enhanced `swap`: DEX token swaps \r\n   - via LiFi aggregation\r\n\r\n<img width=\"745\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 7 10 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed6ad6ba-6338-43d9-a234-5059f3fa144c\">\r\n\r\n3. Fixed type safety issues and improved error handling\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n- Changes to core wallet functionality could impact transaction signing\r\n- Updates to bridge/swap logic could affect cross-chain operations\r\n- ERC-20 integration adds complexity to token handling\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the core changes in:\r\n   - `src/actions/bridge.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/swap.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/transfer.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/getbalance.ts`\r\n\r\n2. Check test implementation:\r\n   - `test/setup.ts` - Test infrastructure\r\n   - `test/actions/bridge.test.ts` - Bridge action tests\r\n   - `test/providers/wallet.test.ts` - Wallet provider tests\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Test basic ETH operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n\r\n// Transfer ETH\r\nawait transferAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Test ERC-20 operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check USDC balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  chain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Bridge tokens\r\nawait bridgeAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  fromChain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  toChain: \"base\",\r\n  amount: \"100\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, documentation updates needed for:\r\n- New ERC-20 functionality\r\n- Updated action parameters\r\n- Testing setup and mocking\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n- Requires environment variables:\r\n  - `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`\r\n  - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` (optional, for token verification)\r\n- Dependencies on LiFi SDK and viem need to be properly versioned\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated to: #735",

Built to support twitter for now.\r\n\r\nLeverages Privy as the account repository and Privy import feature to add users social account. This creates a wallet on behalf of the user that they can claim by logging in with twitter on that Privy instance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the data source could be replaced with an onchain social registry that anyone can opt into themselves to link their socials to a wallet, using TEE-verified oauth. With a reserve vault smart contract layer on top of that, this could hold tokens sent to users that haven't signed up yet and then easily be claimed on signup.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nTo enable agents to send tokens directly to twitter handles without having to know the users wallet address. This could spark entirely new forms of meta games, stories, and economies.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61408862-0a18-4e8e-a656-914dc83f8ee0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ff281c-a152-4f57-8af7-77296e764009)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9b75c4-f29c-4c7f-8f70-70e44770afb4)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`/packages/plugin-social-wallets`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nAdd env values for:\r\n- PRIVY_APP_ID\r\n- PRIVY_APP_SECRET\r\n- EVM_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n- TWITTER_USERNAME\r\n- TWITTER_PASSWORD\r\n- TWITTER_EMAIL\r\n\r\nRun `sh ./scripts/start.sh`\r\nAsk agent `send 0.001 ETH to @<twitter_username>`\r\n\r\nIn addition some adjustments may need to be made to plugin-evm that triggers the TX flow.

Any context or related work?\r\nSimplifies the codebase for future maintenance and readability. Even within the two actions, `SwapAction` and `BridgeAction`, we observe that the constructor has unequal parameters for `createConfig` despite attempting to achieve the same outcome. While this difference does not affect the current implementation, it could lead to some different behaviors in the future, so it's better to inherit a single base class that unifies the LiFi SDK config parameters.\r\n\r\nAlso, fixes passing in an invalid config to `executeRoute`.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.
