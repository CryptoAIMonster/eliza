The implementation provides a reusable and scalable solution for caching data in the application by also implementing the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n\r\n**Implemented Features:**\r\n- `getCache`: Retrieves cached data for a given `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `setCache`: Caches data with a unique key constructed using `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `deleteCache`: Removes cached data for the specified `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- Proper error handling and logging for all Redis operations.\r\n- Integration with the `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` interface.\r\n\r\n**Code Highlights:**\r\n- A new `RedisClient` class implements the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n- The `buildKey` method ensures unique Redis keys for each agent and operation.\r\n- `ioredis` is used for efficient Redis interactions, supporting advanced Redis features like clusters and pipelines if needed in the future.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Provides a scalable and reusable caching solution.\r\n- Ensures clear separation of concerns and adheres to the existing interface.\r\n- Improves application performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe implementation has been tested for the following scenarios:\r\n- Successfully setting a cache entry.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that exists.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that does not exist.\r\n- Deleting a cache entry.\r\n- Handling Redis errors gracefully during operations.\r\n",

This command installs dependencies recursively across all workspaces and refreshes the lockfile to reflect any changes in dependencies.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Updates:** This is a non-breaking change that updates the lockfile to ensure it accurately represents the current state of dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nUpdating the lockfile ensures that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the project can be built and run consistently across different environments. This is particularly important when dependencies have been added, removed, or updated in the `package.json` files.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n<img width=\"285\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-01 at 12 18 56\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5421a78e-b3ec-4234-b494-c431e576087a\" />\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the changes in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to understand the updates to dependency resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. **Clean Install:** Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly with the updated lockfile.\r\n\r\n2. **Run Tests:** Execute the test suite using `pnpm test` to verify that all tests pass with the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n3. **Build Project:** Attempt to build the project using `pnpm build` to confirm that the build process completes successfully.\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Verification:** Run the application locally to ensure it behaves as expected with the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nNo special deployment steps are required. Ensure that the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is included in the deployment to maintain consistency across environments.\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n1. Merge the PR into the main branch.\r\n\r\n2. Pull the latest changes on the deployment environment.\r\n\r\n3. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies as per the updated lockfile.\r\n\r\n4.

Please describe.\r\nThere is currently no seamless integration between TradingView charts and automated tweeting using the GOAT plugin. This makes it cumbersome to share real-time insights, chart setups, or trade ideas directly from TradingView to Twitter with minimal effort. The process involves manual screenshotting and posting, which is time-consuming and disrupts workflow efficiency.\r\n\r\nDescribe the solution you'd like\r\nI would like to see TradingView API integrated with the GOAT plugin to enable automatic or one-click sharing of annotated charts to Twitter. The solution should:\r\n\r\nFetch chart data, annotations, and other custom elements from TradingView via API.\r\nFormat the content appropriately for Twitter, including text captions for context and hashtags.\r\nProvide options to schedule or instantly post tweets from TradingView without switching between platforms.\r\nInclude settings for customization, such as default hashtags, watermarking charts, or adding predefined text templates.\r\nDescribe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nManual Process: Manually screenshotting charts and uploading them to Twitter, but this is inefficient and lacks automation.\r\nThird-party Tools: Using standalone apps like TweetDeck or social media managers, but these don't integrate with TradingView's annotations directly.\r\nCustom Scripts: Writing scripts to automate the TradingView-to-Twitter flow, but this requires significant development time and is not as user-friendly as a plugin-based solution.\r\nAdditional context\r\n\r\nTradingView provides an API that can retrieve chart data and render annotations, which can streamline integration.\r\nThe GOAT plugin already has a Twitter API integration, so extending its capabilities to include TradingView should be feasible.\r\nThis feature could significantly enhance the usability of both tools for traders and content creators.\r\nScreenshot or visual example of an ideal tweet with TradingView integration for reference:\r\n(Include a hypothetical example showing how a TradingView chart and description would appear in a tweet.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, our logging for the Coinbase plugin lacks structured formats and essential context, making it challenging to debug issues effectively and trace requests across services.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a structured logging framework that:\n- Uses JSON format for all logs.\n- Includes standard fields such as timestamp, severity, and correlation ID.\n- Supports context injection for better observability.\n- Has different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).\n- Allows adding custom fields relevant to the Coinbase plugin operations.\n\nFor example, using a logging framework like Winston in Node.js:\n```javascript\nconst logger = require('winston');\nlogger.info('User login attempt', { userId: '12345', correlationId: 'abc-123' });\n```\nThis will greatly assist in correlating events and debugging any issues that may arise.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Relying on plain text logs, which can be cumbersome to parse and analyze.\n- Using manual JSON formatting, which is error-prone.\n- Implementing APM tools without a standardized logging approach.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nEnhancing our logging practices will lead to better monitoring, easier log aggregation, and a more consistent logging pattern, ultimately improving our overall observability and debugging capabilities.",

Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis change is a critical change as it helps the agent scale, reduce database overlap, and separates the agents actions, to ensure proper segregation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this also allows users to create a knowledge folder of txt/md files and reference them in their character knowledge, without having to paste the full contents in character file.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\nMinimal changes to exiting knowledge docs, to outline how to enable the new rag knowledge system.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n- Enable the new rag knowledge \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e1ca71f-800c-47f3-9bd4-6c4103ea2aa5)\r\n\r\n- Create a \"knowledge\" folder within your characters folder\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62b6bfd3-29ad-4a55-81fc-78fcd7d26f6e)\r\n\r\n- Add files in the root of knowledge, or create additional subfolders for organization\r\n\r\n- Set your knowledge items in your character file directly, or objects specifying the path, and if it should be a shared item or not, depending on multi characters or not.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5602960c-2aef-4085-82a9-e13624acf1b6)\r\n\r\n- Start agent(s) as normal, and watch knowledge get processed!\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n### After\r\n\r\nKnowledge table with information and split into chunks, along with main document, shared documents, or agent specific documents in the database.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce69f38e-7fe0-4772-9137-1f6dae424006)\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n## Database changes\r\n - New knowledge table is created\r\n -\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nninja_dev\r\n",

Client Direct:\r\n- Implemented image attachment handling in the `/:agentId/message` POST endpoint.\r\n- Added static file hosting for the direct client so that generated images and uploaded images can be displayed in the client.\r\n\r\n3. Plugin Node:\r\n- Added a `describeImage` Action in the plugin to take advantage of the `ImageDescriptionService` in the same plugin.\r\n- Modified `recognizeWithOpenAI` and `requestOpenAI` to accept local files, similar to how the first frame of .gif files is converted to a buffer and sent over the API\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. `packages/plugin-node/src/services/image.ts` - Core image processing service\r\n2.

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\nfeature: Suppressing initial response messages for specific actions in direct client\r\n\r\nI would like to also extend the twitter client to include this kind of functionality. Right now there is a lot of assumptions about agent behavior such as sending an initial message before an action is processed. Ideally during the upgrade to v2 some of these hard coded behaviors can be addressed. The design should be more conducive to plugin-defined emergent behavior. Maybe there's a discussion to be had at how we can go about this at a lower level rather than going client-by-client to implement this behavior. I'm still relatively new to Eliza community if anyone has groups or public discussions on this.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Changes only affect the direct client's message handling logic.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds support for suppressing initial response messages in the direct client when actions have `suppressInitialMessage` flag set to true. Some actions might not want to send a message until after the action is completed. Now the action will have to manually send a follow up message with the callback.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (changes to existing message handling features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNew property in the `Action` documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Check the modified message handling logic. I've changed `imageGeneration` action to include `suppressInitialMessage` to true for testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create an action with `suppressInitialMessage: true`\r\n2. Send a message to the direct client that triggers this action\r\n3. Verify only the callback message is sent, not the initial response\r\n\r\nKey test cases:\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: true` should only send callback message\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: false` or undefined should send both initial and callback messages\r\n- Action callback functionality should work the same regardless of suppression setting\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n```typescript\r\n                // Check if we should suppress the initial message\r\n                const action = runtime.actions.find(\r\n                    (a) => a.name === response.action\r\n                );\r\n                const shouldSuppressInitialMessage =\r\n                    action?.suppressInitialMessage;\r\n\r\n                const _result = await runtime.processActions(\r\n                    memory,\r\n                    [responseMessage],\r\n                    state,\r\n                    async (newMessages) => {\r\n                        message = newMessages;\r\n                        return [memory];\r\n                    }\r\n                );\r\n\r\n                if (!shouldSuppressInitialMessage) {\r\n                    if (message) {\r\n                        res.json([response, message]);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        res.json([response]);\r\n                    }\r\n                } else {\r\n                    if (message) {\r\n                        res.json([message]);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        res.json([]);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe changes ensure that when an action has `suppressInitialMessage` set to true:\r\n1. The initial response message is not sent in the API response\r\n2. The action's callback message is still sent if present\r\n3. The response array only includes the callback message",

I suggest trying to do use the following to test it locally: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Description: \u201cact\u201d is a command-line utility written in Go that lets you run your GitHub Actions workflows locally.\r\n\u2022 How It Works: It parses your workflow .yml files and simulates GitHub Actions events (push, pull_request, etc.) in Docker containers on your local machine.\r\n\u2022 Why It\u2019s Good:\r\n\r\nGreat for quickly iterating on a workflow without having to push to a branch repeatedly.\r\nLets you see console output, debug logs, and environment variables as if you were running on GitHub.\r\n\u2022 Potential Drawbacks:\r\nNot all GitHub Actions are guaranteed to work seamlessly. Some might rely on GitHub-hosted runners or environment specifics that \u201cact\u201d may not perfectly replicate.\r\nYou need Docker installed locally.\r\n\u2022 How to Get Started Quickly:\r\nInstall Docker.\r\nInstall act (on macOS you can use Homebrew: brew install act, or grab the binary from the GitHub releases page).\r\nFrom your repository, run:\r\nact <event_name>\r\nFor example, act push or act pull_request.\r\nBy default, act uses a lightweight Docker image for its runner; for more complex workflows you might need:\r\nact <event_name> --medium or --workflows .github/workflows/<your_workflow.yml>\r\n"

            "body": "This is my first attempt to contribute to this project. I have been adding features and additional query capability for the Birdeye API and I think many other could benefit.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\n- plugin ecosystem and capabilities for accessing and querying Birdeye data API\r\n- [Expanding Birdeye thread](https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1318974518680748173)\r\n- possible overlap with: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1366\r\n\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- People who already have the BIRDEYE_API_KEY enabled could end up querying the endpoints more\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nThis pull request significantly enhances the Birdeye API integration within the AI agent framework by expanding its capabilities beyond basic query functionality. The proposed tools enable more comprehensive and versatile interactions with the Birdeye API, including data clearing and management features. These improvements provide the AI agents with a broader and more efficient toolkit for handling Birdeye API data, enhancing the overall flexibility and utility of the framework for developers and end-users. By extending the scope of the API integration, this contribution supports more robust and scalable solutions within the project.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds providers that represent all the different API endpoints available in the Birdeye API. By doing so, it ensures that when a user requests a specific type of data, the AI agent has a significantly higher likelihood of accessing and utilizing the relevant data in its response. This enhancement maximizes the agent\u2019s ability to provide accurate and contextually rich answers, leveraging the full scope of the Birdeye API.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- net new plugin\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis API connection is critical for enabling the agent to perform research and analyze the dynamics of the ecosystem effectively. By integrating comprehensive access to all Birdeye API endpoints, this PR lays the groundwork for future enhancements and features that will further expand the agent's capabilities. This integration not only empowers the agent to deliver more insightful and accurate responses but also positions the framework for scalable growth and the addition of advanced functionalities in the future.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a document change is needed, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Yes, this will require the docs to be updated. I am happy to update the appropriate project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

None of the imageSettings from character files which is what the docs currently say to use are actually passed to the API call. So before I submit the PR to add more venice features (I have this PR done as well) I figured I'd submit this to fix imageSettings for character files (while still retaining the ability to pass these options with js etc).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1370\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section is to be filled out before final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow risk, this just provides a fix to an already tested feature.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nWe added relevant imageSettings to our types file, created a call to pull the imageSettings in the image generation plugin and then looked for those settings when making our API call to generate an image.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nThis is a bug fix, I have a feature PR ready for once this is merged.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAt [`Yotta Labs`](https://www.yottalabs.ai/), we are transforming global computing into a high-performance, decentralized AI platform. As part of this mission, I integrated the AI Agent functionality and selected the Eliza framework for managing agent-related tasks. \r\n\r\nWhile configuring the Twitter client and successfully logging into my account, I noticed an issue in the runtime logs: the message `[\"\u25ce Next tweet scheduled in 128 minutes\"]` appeared twice. This indicates that `generateNewTweetLoop` was called twice, resulting in two independent tweet scheduling loops being initialized.\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs because the `start` method in `/packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts` calls `generateNewTweetLoop` twice\u2014once at line 174 and again at line 190\u2014without any conditional checks to prevent multiple timers.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Add the following code to the relevant `character.json` file:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   \"clients\": [\"twitter\"]\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Configure the Twitter-related parameters in the `.env` file, and set `POST_IMMEDIATELY=true` to enable immediate tweet posting.\r\n\r\n3. Start the model service.\r\n\r\n4. Check Twitter, and you will find that two tweets are posted simultaneously. Additionally, the logs show the message `Next tweet scheduled in xxx minutes` printed twice.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe generateNewTweetLoop method should only be invoked once during the start method, ensuring that only a single tweet scheduling loop is active. This would prevent duplicate logs and redundant scheduling timers.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"833\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ebe87aa-ff46-488d-9961-90daf43b5aab\" />\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- File: /packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts\r\n- Method: start\r\n- Lines: 174 and 190\r\n- Observed Behavior: generateNewTweetLoop is called twice without a conditional check, causing two scheduling loops to be initialized.\r\n- Move second generateNewTweetLoop() inside the if (enableActionProcessing)",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8.

This is particularly important as it will improve accessibility and inclusivity for the growing tech community in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Tagalog translation of the main README.md as README_TG.md, including:\r\n- Full translation of all sections, including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines\r\n- Proper formatting to ensure readability\r\n- Addition of Tagalog (Tagalog) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\n- Maintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) \u2013 inadequate because automated translations may not accurately capture technical terms and nuances in Tagalog.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nTagalog is spoken by millions of Filipinos and is one of the primary languages in the Philippines.\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format).\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Filipino developer community.\r\n",

Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241222%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241222T094432Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=1a5dd5544d9787bd4b80ce1fa9db82a9647389b7df93cfd2c0c41a3d7400e4b9)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1.

This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n \r\n# Detailed testing steps\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE.\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

This is how choosing the action replies on Twitter works when the agent would like, re-tweet, Quote, or reply. \n\nIf I want a template to do conditional logic that executes 100% correctly, like a calculation, it would be beneficial, but maybe it's better to add tools for that case.\n\nFrom my point of view, this starts to approach a customized agent direction that requires new builds every time you add new logic. But if it doesn't break all templates w/ the new type accepting strings, then this can be useful.\n\nSome questions:\n- Does this require also editing all the other templates among the different clients as well?\n- Can we expand on the doc to make sure devs understand how to implement this?"

It simply introduces the possibility to pass a function that will resolve the template string. For me, this improves the developer experience by allowing developers to more easily customize their agents, and I\u2019m personally a fan of using function resolvers when building SDKs.\n\nI updated the related documentation I could find, but I may have missed something."

The goal is to allow multiple agents to coordinate on tasks in a way similar to how single-character agents are currently configured, while supporting unique swarm features such as collective decision-making and interactions among multiple agents.\r\n\r\n**Motivation & Rationale**\r\n\r\nEliza currently supports single \u201ccharacter\u201d agents with various providers, settings, and behaviours.\r\nA natural next step is to introduce the ability for multiple agents to work collectively (swarm) on tasks.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Feature Requirements**\r\n\r\n1. Swarm Agent Configuration\r\n\r\n_Support a dedicated configuration block for swarm agents in a manner similar to single-character agents._\r\n\r\n Allow specifying:\r\n- Number of agents in the swarm.\r\n- Provider definitions for each agent (could be the same or different).\r\n- Traditional settings (e.g., roles, personas, capabilities).\r\n- Additional swarm-specific settings (e.g., rules for agent coordination, speaker settings, collective decision-making thresholds).`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Create Swarm Logic.\r\n\r\n- Configure and Execute swarms by importing the core package in external projects.\r\n- Allow all supported clients to use swarm logic without disrupting current flows(ex: the last agent in a twitter maker team will post as a singular agent akin to current implementation).\r\n- Write dedicated test suite or carefully extend the current tests to confirm proper handling of the majority of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Document feature:\r\n\r\n- How multiple agents can be spawned and coordinated. \r\n- How tasks or sub-tasks are delegated among swarm agents (e.g., parallel vs. sequential).\r\n- How swarm memory storage works.\r\n- Document possible flows.\r\n- How can the utility be extended further. \r\n\r\n",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAt _packages/core/src/generate.ts_ When the `imageModelProvider` did not match `modelProvider`, the code iteratively checked for API keys in a fallback chain. It stopped at the first available key (e.g., FAL_API_KEY), even if it belonged to the wrong provider. As a result, the selected API key could be incorrect (e.g., returning and using a key from FAL instead key from Venice).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Set imageModelProvider to VENICE in the character configuration.\r\n2. Provide both FAL_API_KEY and VENICE_API_KEY in .env(or any other relevant key combination).\r\n3. When requesting an image generation observe that the code selects FAL_API_KEY instead of VENICE_API_KEY.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf a specific imageModelProvider is set, the code should return the matching API key for that provider if it exists. If no specific provider key is found, the code should then try the fallback chain in sequence.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c086855-48b3-42ba-b410-6f87c2513711)\r\n\r\n**Fix** \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c59fae1b-652c-41e1-9540-fa2c2a85cba7)\r\n\r\n`const apiKey =\r\n    runtime.imageModelProvider === runtime.modelProvider\r\n        ? runtime.token\r\n        : (() => {\r\n            // First try to match the specific provider\r\n            switch (runtime.imageModelProvider) {\r\n                case ModelProviderName.HEURIST:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.TOGETHER:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.FAL:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.OPENAI:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.VENICE:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n                default:\r\n                    // If no specific match, try the fallback chain\r\n                    return (runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n            }\r\n        })();`\r\n\r\nThis fix updates the logic to first attempt to retrieve the API key from the specifically selected imageModelProvider. If that is not present, it will proceed down the fallback chain. This ensures that if an an image model api key is set, it is correctly chosen over other existing keys which are higher in the selection list, like FAL_API_KEY.\r\n\r\nPS: Solution is implemented and tested, creating bug report for tracked pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "Add the ability of liquid staking to the current elizaos solana plugin.\r\n\r\n- It can build the desired staking requests for end-users, eliminating the complexity of front-end development and the need for users to switch between multiple platforms to compare APYs and select staking protocols.\r\n- Currently supports five protocols: \"jito\", \"blaze\", \"jpool\", \"marinade\", \"marginfi\", and is capable of expanding to support more protocols.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1434\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- There are no risks. An independent new Solana feature module has been introduced without modifying the code of other parts.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- There are some distinctive liquid staking solutions on Solana. However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n- The StakeProtocolProvider uses the [Solana LST data provider](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/solana-lst-data-provider) open-sourced by stafiprotocol to provide data support. You can choose to use the default Stafi API or deploy it yourself.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Enable @elizaos/plugin-solana in the character.\r\n2. Interact with the Agent, for example: \u201cMy address is HqvTPqS2FaB2fQ7mxqZHQHz6H28o1u2Z9fRH5No8JN2W and I want to stake 0.01 SOL\u201d.\r\n3.

An independent new Solana feature module has been introduced without modifying the code of other parts.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- There are some distinctive liquid staking solutions on Solana. However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1.

This reduces flexibility and can increase development complexity in scenarios where different models are needed.\r\n\r\nWhen using a non-OpenAI AI provider, an error is reported because the gpt-4o model cannot be found.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n- Remove the hard-coded `model class` reference in the `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse` function and instead use a model name/type passed in as a function parameter or configuration.\r\n- Ensure there is a sensible default value to maintain compatibility with existing functionality or cases where a specific model is not provided.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- Leaving it as is would require manual code changes to switch models in different scenarios, which is not ideal.\r\n- Introducing a separate function to handle switching model classes could lead to redundant logic and increase maintenance overhead.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- **Risks**: This change is minor, but it\u2019s important to check if other parts of the code depend on the old hard-coded logic.\r\n- **Testing**:\r\n  - Test with multiple model types to confirm that the function correctly switches to the specified model.",

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nI cloned a fresh repo from the release 1.7 and ran a default character with twitter client. My .env contained an Openai API key and I used a venice API model for my agent. I got authentication error (see issue 1634 post  when trying to get image description from a twitter post. \r\n\r\nNOTE : This only fixes the authentification issue, the agent still won't be able to get the description from images in a twitter post. I will create a seperate issue and PR to solve this issue shortly.\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nI ran pnpm test and pnpm lint locally but did not include them in the PR since only 1 file is changed.\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

After applying this fix, the query execution time dropped to just **0.02 seconds**. This improvement was observed using Supabase analytics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Changes to existing functionality to improve database query performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts` to understand how sorting and limiting were implemented in the database query.\r\n- Look at the adjusted runtime logic in `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` for the integration of the `limit` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Ensure all existing tests for memory fetching pass.\r\n2. Manually test the memory-fetching feature by:\r\n   - Querying with and without the `limit` parameter.\r\n   - Verifying that the sorting order (`createdAt DESC`) is maintained.\r\n3. Monitor query performance with larger datasets to confirm improvements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n- Updated query logic to include `ORDER BY createdAt DESC` and optional `LIMIT` in the PostgreSQL adapter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nI will attach screenshots of:\r\n- Successful working run with Postgres and SQLite.\r\n- Successful linting results.\r\n\r\n### Using Postgres adapter\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1054\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 13 52\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3606a21a-6933-402b-ae7d-d24ecb6a1263\" />\r\n<img width=\"1126\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 15 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b8a289-1cae-4a2f-9493-25cf79dc2d4b\" />\r\n\r\n### Using SQLite adapter\r\n<img width=\"1087\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 16 57\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a7f49f4-9880-4d4a-9586-d9548fda7dd5\" />\r\n<img width=\"543\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 18 52\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e04f844-ab14-44e3-a7f4-2601a853af46\" />\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 28 45\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82b35cad-c73a-46d0-b52c-5b1e05d87388\" />\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 29 47\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857b593f-f9e4-4774-a44a-358ea26155d8\" />\r\n",

            "body": "# Secure interoperable agents\r\n\r\nAI is transforming consumer tech, with messaging becoming the main channel for interacting with agent services. This shift will scale message traffic astronomically, analogous to the web\u2019s rise in the 2000s. Just as Cloudflare and https secured web traffic, messaging will need robust scalable end-to-end encrypted messages to protect sensitive information.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nRisks of not using end-to-end encryption for agent interactions exposes the users to what is called as Man in the **Middle Attacks**.\r\n\r\n> **Man in the Middle Attacks**: Intercept requests in between to alter or manipulate data sent or received by the AI service\r\n\r\n- **Phishing**: Messages can be intercepted and manipulated.\r\n- **Privacy**: Sensitive information read by unwanted parties\r\n- **Tampering**: Content can be altered without detection.\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> More concrete sensitive data could include credit card details, private keys and passwords which is not yet widely spread but as agents become smarter more use cases will include this type of sharing.\r\n\r\n## XMTP\r\n\r\nEliza agents come with a ready to use client that uses XMTP providing end-to-end encrypted messaging for every agent intereaction, crucial for privacy, security, and compliance provided by the XMTP network.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n\r\n- **E2EE**: End to end encrypted MLS encryption\r\n- **Multi-agent**: Support multi-agent through group chats\r\n- **Interoperable**: Works across all platforms and frontends\r\n- **Scalable**: Decentralized, open-source\r\n- **Anonymous**: By default every identity is ephemeral and anonymous.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nInstall the `xmtp` package\r\n\r\n```bash [cmd]\r\nbun install xmtp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis is how you can use the `xmtp` package to create an agent and handle messages.\r\n\r\n- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: This will encrypt all messages and make it available through its public address or ens domain.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { XMTP } from \"xmtp\";\r\n\r\nconst xmtp = new XMTP(onMessage, {\r\n    encryptionKey: WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY,\r\n});\r\nawait xmtp.init();\r\nconst onMessage = async (message, user) => {\r\n    console.log(`Decoded message: ${message.content.text} by ${user.address}`);\r\n    // Your AI model response\r\n    await xmtp.send({\r\n        message: response,\r\n        originalMessage: message,\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information visit XMTP [website](https://xmtp.org/)",

It can be taken much further such as adding media to the blog posts and making more in-depth articles.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis adds a new client for Eliza. It lets you create and upload blog posts to Wordpress.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis adds another useful client for Elizas in expanding their capabilities outside of the conventional social media platforms. Eliza's can now generate blog content for Wordpress autonomously.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n<img width=\"677\" alt=\"395838026-32e68360-ba16-4ede-af04-d75226839050\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36b49e51-f84d-4637-9886-71c6a97f1f1a\" />\r\n<img width=\"883\" alt=\"395838018-459458d4-820a-46e3-9ee9-26be97b3ba72\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a8c4c0b-8c3e-4aba-a1f7-202f45b63647\" />\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n/packages/client-wordpress\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nAdd env values for:\r\n\r\nWORDPRESS_DRY_RUN\r\nWORDPRESS_USERNAME\r\nWORDPRESS_PASSWORD (Application password)\r\nWORDPRESS_URL\r\n\r\nRun sh ./scripts/start.sh\r\nIf client is set up correctly, you should see a blog post generated every 24 hours.\r\n\r\nIn addition some adjustments may need to be made with setting the post to \"draft\" or \"publish\".\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@ineedtendies",

Trump says silly offensive stuff, and we wanted to capture that. He would not say SARS-COVID-19. I disagree with about 99% of the stuff he says, and 99% of the stuff his character file says. That being said, I care about art, and not letting art be compromised by politics.\r\n\r\nWe love people all over the world, and personally I will be visiting China in a couple days to meet everyone. I don't believe that we should be against any group for their nationality. But we shouldn't kill the comedy and make our characters worse-- that's why OpenAI's models suck now. It's a slippery slope that will reduce bravery, integrity and quality."

The intelligence of an AI agent depends on two key factors:\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the underlying AI model.\r\n\r\nThe quality, quantity, and timeliness of the data it processes.\r\n\r\nUsing personal Twitter accounts for scraping data poses significant risks, including account bans and rate limits. This plugin provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution for fetching Twitter data, which has already been validated through millions of executions on Apify.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am offering free usage credits to help developers get started quickly and contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed?\r\nI added a new environment variable and have updated the documentation in all relevant languages. I also explained the purpose of this variable.\r\nTWITTER_API_IO_KEY=\r\n#A third-party Twitter API key for data retrieval. This shared key is for testing only - get your personal key at https://twitterapi.io to avoid QPS limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

Please describe.**\r\nour current implementation lacks support for azure's suite of models, which limits our ability to fully utilize their ecosystem. this creates challenges when integrating with organizations heavily invested in azure for their infrastructure and services. without support for azure models, we're unable to offer flexibility to teams looking to standardize their ai deployments within azure environments.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd support for all azure models across our platform. this includes providing seamless integration for model hosting, training, and inferencing via azure's api and tools. users should be able to deploy and manage models using azure's ecosystem with the same ease and functionality offered for other supported providers.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nrelying on third-party middleware or custom solutions to bridge the gap between our platform and azure's services. however, these are often cumbersome and introduce maintenance overhead.\r\ncontinuing to use existing supported providers exclusively, but this limits our ability to work with azure-focused organizations and may push potential users away.\r\ndeveloping an entirely separate module for azure models, though this could lead to fragmentation in our feature set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nazure is one of the leading cloud platforms, with a growing presence in the ai and ml space. support for azure models would unlock access to their advanced tools like azure machine learning, cognitive services, and integration with microsoft products. this would make our platform more appealing to enterprise customers already using azure for their cloud infrastructure. this could start out as just support for openai in azure but you can imagine how powerful the azure apis could be for using [all of the supported models](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)",

            "body": "\r\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nTypeScript type error in Slack client when handling message attachments. The error occurs because the `attachments` property in the `Content` interface expects an array of `Media` type objects, but the code was only providing a subset of the required properties.\r\n\r\n**Error message:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nType '{ text: string; }[]' is not assignable to type 'Media[]'.\r\nType '{ text: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Media': id, url, title, source, description\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use the Slack client implementation.\r\n2. Try to create a message content with attachments.\r\n3. The code attempts to create an attachment with only the `text` property:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent ? [{ text: attachmentContent }] : undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe code should properly implement the `Media` type interface by providing all required properties:\r\n\r\n- `id` (string)\r\n- `url` (string)\r\n- `title` (string)\r\n- `source` (string)\r\n- `description` (string)\r\n- `text` (string)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nUpdate the attachment creation to include all required `Media` type properties:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent\r\n    ? [{\r\n        id: stringToUuid(`${event.ts}-attachment`),\r\n        url: '',  // Since this is text content, no URL is needed\r\n        title: 'Text Attachment',\r\n        source: 'slack',\r\n        description: 'Text content from Slack message',\r\n        text: attachmentContent\r\n    }]\r\n    : undefined,\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nThis issue affects the Slack client's message handling functionality in the `packages/client-slack/src/messages.ts` file. The fix ensures type safety while maintaining the intended functionality of handling text attachments from Slack messages.",

Then, examine the updates made to `packages/core/src/generation.ts`, `packages/core/src/models.ts`, `packages/core/src/types.ts` and the `agent/src/index.ts` handlers under API configurations to understand the response handling.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables**:  \r\n   - Ensure that `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` are correctly set in the environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Run `pnpm add` to install the new `fereai-provider` module.\r\n\r\n3. **Run Unit Tests**:  \r\n   - Execute the `fereai-provider` test suite to verify that all existing and new tests pass successfully.\r\n   - For `fereai-provider` tests, refer to the [fereai-provider tests](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider/blob/main/packages/fereai/src/fereai.test.ts).\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing**:  \r\n   - Interact with the chatbot to ensure that responses are handled correctly and that the integration with FereAI APIs functions as expected using `fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Monitor logs to confirm that structured logging is operational and that no errors related to the new integration occur.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

            "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, we observed issues with aixbt, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Reclaim as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Reclaim is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nUpdates \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating **Reclaim** as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zero-knowledge proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-reclaim README.\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Proof Verification Example\r\nBelow is a screenshot showcasing the generated proof and its verification process:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 39 17\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c64b01-47b1-4ece-8624-9b65e7624f66\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 31 20\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41d675e-9249-4c46-9f12-396f02b7d8b2\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure the following environment variables (generated from the [Reclaim Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)):\r\n```\r\n# Reclaim Protocol\r\nRECLAIM_APP_ID= # Reclaim App ID\r\nRECLAIM_APP_SECRET= # Reclaim App Secret\r\n\r\n# Verifiable Inference Configuration\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_ENABLED=true # Set to true to enable verifiable inference\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=reclaim # Options: reclaim, opacity (soon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run a character using the command:\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"`\r\n\r\n3. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n4. Interact with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- Automated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n- No database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n--> Gajesh#0000\r\n",

            "body": "# Risks\r\nLow. Existing users who relied on Deepgram by default will still see no change unless they explicitly define a new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`. Fallback logic preserves original behavior (Deepgram \u2192 OpenAI \u2192 Local).\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- **Adds** an optional `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` setting (`deepgram`, `openai`, or `local`) with fallback logic.  \r\n  - If not set, old behavior remains: Deepgram \u2192 OpenAI \u2192 Local.\r\n- **Moves** Twitter Spaces plugins from `agent-twitter-client` into this repo for better flexibility and less friction in plugin development.\r\n- **Introduces** an AI-driven Twitter Spaces flow:\r\n  1. **Automatic** Space launch decisions (random chance, business hours, cooldown intervals).\r\n  2. **Multi-speaker** logic with queue management (`maxSpeakers`).\r\n  3. GPT-based filler/idle messages, optional STT/TTS bridging, local audio recording.\r\n  4. Graceful shutdown and cooldown for repeated Spaces.\r\n\r\n### Transcription Service Changes\r\n- We introduced a new **`TranscriptionProvider` enum** (`Deepgram`, `OpenAI`, or `Local`) to replace string flags.\r\n- In `initialize()`, the **provider is chosen in this order**:\r\n  1. `character.settings.transcription` (if the API keys exist),\r\n  2. `.env` (`TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`),\r\n  3. Old fallback logic (Deepgram \u2192 OpenAI \u2192 Local) if neither is configured.\r\n- For example, in your `character.json`, you can specify:\r\n  ```json5\r\n  {\r\n    // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n      \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  If you have `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set, the service will use Deepgram; otherwise it continues to the next check.\r\n- `processQueue()` uses a `switch` on `this.transcriptionProvider` to pick the final method (`transcribeWithDeepgram`, `transcribeWithOpenAI`, or `transcribeLocally`).\r\n\r\n## Flow Recap\r\n1. **Periodic Check**  \r\n   - If no Space is running, possibly launch one by `shouldLaunchSpace()` (random chance, business hours, cooldown).  \r\n   - If a Space is running, `manageCurrentSpace()` handles speaker timeouts, occupancy updates, queue acceptance, etc.\r\n\r\n2. **Space Creation**  \r\n   - Generates a `SpaceConfig` (topics from config or GPT).  \r\n   - Attaches plugins: audio recording, STT/TTS, idle monitor, etc.  \r\n   - Hooks into `speakerRequest`, `occupancyUpdate`, `idleTimeout`, etc.\r\n\r\n3. **Speaker Logic**  \r\n   - Maintains an `activeSpeakers` array + a queue if at capacity (`maxSpeakers`).  \r\n   - Enforces `speakerMaxDurationMs` per speaker.  \r\n   - If a speaker is removed, accept next in queue if available.\r\n\r\n4. **Stopping**  \r\n   - `stopSpace()` finalizes the Space, logs completion, clears states, etc.  \r\n   - Resumes periodic checks at a slower interval until the next launch is decided.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### A) `.env` / Environment Variables\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Transcription Provider\r\nTRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=         # Default is local (possible values: deepgram, openai, local)\r\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\r\nDEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### B) `character.json` \u2192 `\"twitterSpaces\"` Field\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n  }\r\n  \"twitterSpaces\": {\r\n    \"maxSpeakers\": 2,\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"Blockchain Trends\",\r\n      \"AI Innovations\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"typicalDurationMinutes\": 45,\r\n    \"idleKickTimeoutMs\": 300000,\r\n    \"minIntervalBetweenSpacesMinutes\": 60,\r\n    \"businessHoursOnly\": true,\r\n    \"randomChance\": 0.3,\r\n    \"enableIdleMonitor\": true,\r\n    \"enableSttTts\": true,\r\n    \"enableRecording\": false,\r\n    \"voiceId\": \"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\",\r\n    \"sttLanguage\": \"en\",\r\n    \"gptModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\r\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful AI co-host assistant.\",\r\n    \"speakerMaxDurationMs\": 240000\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **`maxSpeakers`**: number of concurrent speakers allowed.\r\n- **`topics`**: if none are provided, GPT generates them dynamically.\r\n- **`randomChance`**: probability for each check cycle to spawn a new Space.\r\n- **`speakerMaxDurationMs`**: maximum time each speaker can speak before removal.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Features** (new Twitter Spaces integration and optional transcription provider).\r\n- **Improvements** (unified plugin development, more config options, fallback logic maintained).\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, minimal. We must mention:\r\n- The new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (optional).\r\n- The new `twitterSpaces` config section in `character.json`.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Check `transcription.service.ts` to review how it resolves conflicts by prioritizing character settings, then `.env`, then old fallback.\r\n- Check new or relocated Twitter Spaces integration files for the Space lifecycle (launch, speaker management, idle detection, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Define `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (or leave it empty to keep old fallback).\r\n2. Provide valid API keys if choosing `deepgram` or `openai`.\r\n3. Define `twitterSpaces.randomChance` in the character JSON to `1` (for a 100% rate of starting a space).\r\n4. Run the agent; verify that Spaces launch automatically, respect the chosen transcription provider, and handle multi-speaker logic as expected.\r\n\r\nNo special database migrations are needed. Basic local runs and logs confirm correct functioning.\r\n\r\n# Future Improvements\r\n\r\n- **More robust decision logic** for accepting speakers, switching, and timeouts.  \r\n- **Realtime API plugin** for smoother, on-the-fly conversation handling.  \r\n- **Solo Broadcast Mode**: launch Spaces focused on a single host monologue with no external speakers.  \r\n- **True VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** to detect when a speaker finishes talking, instead of relying on manual mute/unmute cues.  \r\n- **Advanced scheduling triggers** (e.g., event-based or calendar-based).  \r\n- **Analytics & insights** for post-Space summaries or usage metrics.\r\n\r\n---",

I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.  I know there is alot of interest in the memory system as well so as part of the core it should be as clear as possible IMHO."

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces support for TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) logging and enables the Eliza application to run within Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions).\r\n\r\nAs Eliza is a fully autonomous AI agent capable of running within a TEE, we need to demonstrate to the outside world that we are indeed operating within a TEE. This allows external parties to verify that our actions are protected by the TEE and that they are entirely executed by Eliza, without any third-party interference. Therefore, it is necessary to leverage TEE's remote attestation and establish a TEE logging mechanism to prove that these operations are entirely and autonomously performed by Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the existing plugin-tee only supports running Eliza in dstack TDX CVM. However, although TDX is more convenient to use, Intel SGX remains a highly popular TEE in production environments. With the help of Gramine LibOS, it is possible to support running Eliza in SGX, thereby enabling the deployment of Eliza in a broader range of TEE scenarios.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n1. Support running Eliza in SGX\r\n2. Add plugin-sgx to support SGX attestation \r\n3. Add plugin-tee-log to support TEE logging (Gramine SGX and Dstack TDX)\r\n4. Add REST API in client-direct to support retrieve TEE logs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n## TEE Logging Mechanism:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Key Pair Generation and Attestation**:\r\n   - During startup, each agent generates a key pair and creates a remote attestation for the public key. The private key is securely stored in the TEE's encrypted memory. The agent's relevant information, along with the public key and attestation, is recorded in a local database. A new key pair is generated each time the agent is updated or restarted to ensure key security.\r\n\r\n2. **Log Recording**:\r\n   - For each log entry, basic information is recorded, including `agentId`, `roomId`, `userId`, `type`, `content`, and `timestamp`. This information is concatenated and signed using the agent's corresponding private key to ensure verifiability. The verification process follows this trust chain:\r\n     - Verify the attestation.\r\n     - Trust the public key contained in the attestation.\r\n     - Use the public key to verify the signature.\r\n     - Trust the complete log record.\r\n\r\n3. **Data Storage**:\r\n   - All log data must be stored in the TEE's encrypted file system in production environments. Storing data in plaintext is prohibited to prevent tampering.\r\n\r\n4. **Log Extraction for Verification**:\r\n   - Third parties can extract TEE logs for verification purposes. Two types of information can be extracted:\r\n     - **Agent Information**: This includes the agent's metadata, public key, and attestation, which can be used to verify the agent's public key.\r\n     - **Log Information**: Required logs can be extracted, with the agent's attestation and public key used to verify the signature, ensuring that each record remains untampered.\r\n\r\n5. **Integrity Protection**:\r\n   - When users extract TEE logs via the REST API, the results are hashed, and an attestation is generated. After extraction, users can verify the attestation by comparing the hash value contained within it to the extracted results, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeed to add new documentation about TEE logging and how to run Eliza in SGX\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. SGX Gramine support\r\n2. plugin-sgx\r\n3. plugin-tee-log\r\n4. other parts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n### Test SGX support\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to prepare the SGX environment and install the Gramine dependencies according to https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\r\n\r\nThen, start eliza in SGX:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npnpm i\r\npnpm build\r\n\r\n# Start default character\r\nSGX=1 make start\r\n# Start specific character\r\nSGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/trump.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test TEE logging\r\n\r\nTo get started, prepare the TEE environment. Both dstack TDX and Gramine SGX are supported.\r\n\r\nNext, enable TEE logging by configuring the .env file:\r\n```\r\nENABLE_TEE_LOG=true \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logging isn't integrated for actions by default, you need to integrate the logging for the actions you want to log. For example, if you want to log the `Continue` action of plugin-bootstrap, you can do the following:\r\n\r\nFirst, add plugin-tee-log to the dependencies of plugin-bootstrap:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"@elizaos/plugin-tee-log\": \"workspace:*\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, add the following code to the `Continue` action:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {\r\n    ServiceType,\r\n    ITeeLogService,\r\n} from \"@elizaos/core\";\r\n\r\n\r\n// In the handler of the action\r\n    handler: async (\r\n        runtime: IAgentRuntime,\r\n        message: Memory,\r\n        state: State,\r\n        options: any,\r\n        callback: HandlerCallback\r\n    ) => {\r\n        // Continue the action\r\n\r\n        // Log the action\r\n        const teeLogService = runtime\r\n            .getService<ITeeLogService>(ServiceType.TEE_LOG)\r\n            .getInstance();\r\n        if (teeLogService.log(\r\n                runtime.agentId,\r\n                message.roomId,\r\n                message.userId,\r\n                \"The type of the log, for example, Action:CONTINUE\",\r\n                \"The content that you want to log\"\r\n            )\r\n        ) {\r\n            console.log(\"Logged TEE log successfully\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Continue the action\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

In my tests, running Eliza smoothly in SGX requires configuring 64GB of EPC memory. Such a large memory footprint is caused by some indirect dependencies of Eliza on WASM. WASM requests a significant amount of memory during initialization, and configuring a smaller memory size will result in OOM (Out of Memory) errors.\r\n\r\nI will soon update a detailed step-by-step guide for running Eliza in SGX.\r\n"

                "body": "> SGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/c3po.character.json\"\r\n\r\nHi, I tested it in SGX using a clean project and have added a quick start guide for running it in SGX.\r\n\r\nDuring the following steps, the only issue I encountered was a build error caused by the missing plugin-tee dependency in plugin-tee-log. This error can be resolved by simply running the build command again. However, this is an issue that needs to be addressed later.\r\n\r\nOther than that, everything worked smoothly during the test. If you encounter any other issues while following these steps, please feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\nNote: Currently, I have set the SGX EPC size (memory size) to 64 GB in the Gramine manifest. In reality, Eliza itself does not require this much memory. However, some dependencies of Eliza rely on WebAssembly (WASM), and initializing WASM demands a significant amount of memory. If the memory is insufficient, you may encounter the following error:\r\n\r\n`RangeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Out of memory: Cannot allocate Wasm memory for a new instance.`\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this issue, I configured the enclave size to 64 GB. This is a temporary workaround, and we need to optimize WASM memory usage in the future.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to prepare a SGX enabled machine.\r\n\r\nThen, you can use the following command to start a Gramine Docker container:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo docker run -it --name eliza_sgx \\\r\n    --mount type=bind,source={your_eliza_path},target=/root/eliza \\\r\n    --device /dev/sgx/enclave \\\r\n    --device /dev/sgx/provision \\\r\n    gramineproject/gramine:stable-jammy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter entering the docker, you can use the following command to prepare the Eliza environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Generate the private key for signing the SGX enclave\r\ngramine-sgx-gen-private-key\r\n\r\ncd /root/eliza/\r\n\r\n# Install nodejs and pnpm\r\n# Node.js will be installed at `/usr/bin/node`.\r\n# Gramine will utilize this path as the default Node.js location to run Eliza.\r\n# If you prefer to use nvm for installing Node.js, please ensure to specify the Node.js path in the Makefile, as the installation path for nvm is not `/usr/bin/node`.\r\napt update\r\napt install -y build-essential\r\napt install -y curl\r\ncurl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_23.x | bash -\r\napt install -y nodejs=23.3.0-1nodesource1\r\nnpm install -g pnpm\r\n\r\n# Build Eliza\r\npnpm i\r\n# The build may fail on the first attempt due to the missing `plugin-tee` dependency in `plugin-tee-log`. Simply run the build command again to resolve the issue.\r\n# TODO: fix the build issue\r\npnpm build\r\n\r\n# Copy the .env.example file to .env\r\ncp .env.example .env\r\n# Edit the .env file\r\n\r\n# Start Eliza in SGX\r\nSGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/c3po.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n"

This could cause pre-existing embeddings and new embeddings to be incompatible.\r\n\r\nI removed `isOllama` flag from the config.

It is technically a change in behavior because using ollama with a url override will no longer strip the trailing v1/.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nAdded support for environment variables:\r\n- USE_VOYAGEAI_EMBEDDING\r\n- VOYAGEAI_API_KEY\r\n- VOYAGEAI_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS\r\n- VOYAGEAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL Configuration follows existing patterns.

Update `generateText` API to be able to pass through tool options to leverage the model's tool calling capabilities\r\n2. Update the GOAT plugin to use tool calling allowing it to perform complex onchain actions that require multiple steps. Now developers can define high level actions (swap, bet on Polymarket, stake, etc.) and GOAT will take care of handling each action (see the screenshots below)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nI have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo and build it\r\n2. Set up the `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` env variables\r\n3. Uncomment lines 70-72 in the `actions.ts` file in the GOAT plugin\r\n4. Prompt the agent with \"Swap 0.1 USDC for MODE using KIM in a single hop\"\r\n5. In the agent logs you should see all the different steps that the agent is making\r\n6. The tx should fail unless you have ETH and USDC in MODE :)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\nAgent can just do one function call so you need to specify the inputs like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11cec757-fdb1-43b8-affc-562380a38184)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After\r\nAgent can do multiple function calls in an action so inputs are more human friendly:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f80382c-f48f-4096-a2ab-a2cafa72477d)\r\n\r\nIn the background you can also log all the different tool interactions:\r\n<img width=\"630\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 16 24 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/627792d8-eeb7-4110-b2ef-33dd8c83f3da\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\naguspunk\r\n",

            "body": "Title: Standardize boolean values and fix pattern for .env file\r\n\r\nDescribe the bug\r\nThe `.env` file contains some inconsistencies in how boolean values and specific strings are represented. For instance, the variable `POST_IMMEDIATELY` uses the string \"NO\", while a boolean value like `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE` uses `false`. This inconsistency could lead to parsing issues and is prone to human error. \r\n\r\nTo Reproduce\r\n1. Open the `.env` file. 2. Observe that `POST_IMMEDIATELY=NO` is used instead of the expected `false`. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n Boolean variables should consistently use `true` or `false`, and all string-based boolean values such as `POST_IMMEDIATELY` should use `true`/`false` instead of `\"YES\"`/`\"NO\"`. \r\n\r\nAdditional context\r\n This change will standardize boolean values, making the `.env` file easier to parse and reducing the risk of errors. The `parseBooleanFromText` function, declared as `const parseBooleanFromText: (text: string) => boolean;`, can be used outside the `.env` context to ensure boolean parsing is consistent across the codebase. \r\n\r\nGuidelines for .env values\r\n\r\n1. **Boolean values**: Always use `true` or `false` (not `\"YES\"` or `\"NO\"`). \r\nExample: ``` TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true POST_IMMEDIATELY=false ``` \r\n\r\n Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and make it easier for automated scripts to process the `.env` file while reduce  human error.",

Any stored references or comparisons to old UUIDs will no longer match.\r\n\r\n### Risks & Impact\r\n\r\n- **Risk**: Existing code/data relying on old UUIDs may break or create duplicates.\r\n- **Mitigation**: We can choose to:\r\n    1. Merge only the **tests** for now, keeping the existing UUID generation.\r\n    2. Merge the bit fix (and re-key), but accept the breaking change or plan a migration.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\n1. **(Option A)** Merge only the tests and skip the version-bit fix for now (to avoid re-keying).\r\n2. **(Option B)** Merge both tests and fix, but coordinate any needed data migration or accept re-keying.",

Version-Bit Fix \u2014 applies the change that correctly sets the version 5 bits, which would re-key existing data.\r\n\r\nSince the second part can be disruptive, I\u2019d appreciate guidance or help on how best to handle existing data or references.

            "body": "_sup fam, today i put in a few hours to extend the Eliza framework by adding some core trading functionality for on-chain solana bots. my focus was to create a set of tools that will allow agents to execute trades, manage risk, and pull critical data. here's what I added and worked on:_\r\n\r\n**What I Added/Completed Today:**\r\n\r\n1. nice_funcs.py:\r\n\r\n- Added a library of helpful functions tailored for Solana on-chain trading.\r\n- Functions now include position management, wallet holdings fetching, and other utilities to make trading more efficient.\r\n- This has been tested with my personal bots but should integrate well with Eliza\u2019s architecture.\r\n\r\n2. bot.py:\r\n\r\n- Built a script that allows agents to perform trading actions such as:\r\n- Closing a position (action 0).\r\n- Opening a position (action 1).\r\n- Adding stop-loss logic (action 2).\r\n- Implementing breakout trades (action 3).\r\n- Market-making logic (action 5).\r\n- Currently, it uses basic user input to decide the action, but this will soon be fully bot-driven.\r\n\r\n3. get_ohlcv_data.py\r\n\r\n- this allows the agent to get open, high, low, close and volume data\r\n- also have moving averages and examples of other technical indicators\r\n\r\n4. dontshare.py (ignored):\r\n\r\n- Added placeholders for sensitive information such as:\r\n- Solana private keys.\r\n- BirdEye API keys.\r\n- RPC URLs.\r\n- Added this file to .gitignore to ensure it doesn\u2019t get accidentally pushed.\r\n\r\n5. Updated README.md:\r\n\r\n- Wrote a comprehensive README to document how to use these new tools and scripts.\r\n- It includes detailed steps for configuration, usage, and what each action/script does.\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Why This Matters:**\r\n\r\n- These tools lay the groundwork for enabling AI agents to perform advanced trading strategies directly on-chain.\r\n- The added functionality simplifies interaction with Solana contracts while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.\r\n- It ensures agents can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention\u2014just plug in the strategy, and they're good to go.\r\n\r\n**What's Next?**\r\n\r\n- I'm researching the best way to transition from Python to TypeScript or add a shell for TS compatibility, depending on the project direction.\r\n- Planning to integrate more trading actions like:\r\n- Funding buys (action 6).\r\n- Liquidation monitoring (action 7).\r\n- Always happy to hear feedback on how this integrates with Eliza\u2019s current architecture and if there are specific improvements to focus on.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity to contribute. Let me know if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to adjust or refine for tomorrow.",

This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. \n\n### Details\nI have exploited this vulnerability in a Windows service using version 5.22.11 of the module, to escalate privileges (in an environment where I am authorized to do so). However, as far as I can see from the code, it is still present in master branch at time of writing, on line [403/404 of network.js](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/blob/3a92931c7d46605ffddc1aacb97a9727273b2888/lib/network.js#L403).\n\nThe SSID is obtained from `netsh wlan show interface ...` in `getWindowsWirelessIfaceSSID`, and then passed to `cmd.exe /d /s /c \"netsh wlan show profiles ...` in `getWindowsIEEE8021x`, without sanitization.\n\n### PoC\nFirst, the command injection payload should be included in the connected Wi-Fi SSID. For example create hotspot on mobile phone or other laptop, set SSID to payload, connect to it with victim Windows system. Two example SSID's to demonstrate exploitation are below.\n\nDemonstration to run ping command indefinitely:\n```\na\" | ping /t 127.0.0.1 &\n```\n\nRun executable with privileges of the user in which vulnerable function is executed. Chosen executable should should be placed in (assuming system drive is C): `C:\\a\\a.exe`.\n```\na\" | %SystemDrive%\\a\\a.exe &\n```\n\nThen, the vulnerable function can be executed on the victim system, for example, using:\n```\nconst si = require('systeminformation');\nsi.networkInterfaces((net) => { console.log(net) });\n```\n\nNow the chosen command, `PING.exe` or `a.exe` will be run through the cmd.exe command line.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>sebhildebrandt/systeminformation (systeminformation)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.23.8`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n### [`v5.23.6`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone UTC, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

            "body": "# Relates to: AWS Secrets Manager Integration & Security\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nThis reduces risks by allowing offloading all API keys and secrets to Secrets Manager instead of leaving them raw in a .env\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nIn settings.ts in package/core, rather than just pulling from .env, it also grabs any secrets manager secret names you specify. You can STILL keep all your keys directly in .env, but if you specify \"SECRET_NAMES\" in your .env, it will pull secrets through that from AWS along with anything in the .env\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Create an AWS account. Free-tier is enough. \r\n2. In Secrets Manager, create a secret named \"secret/myagentname\" (this can be named anything but this format is nice). \r\n3. Add in all the keys you have in your .env currently as key value pairs in this secret and save.\r\n\r\n### IAM Role Setup:\r\nFirst, create an IAM Policy:\r\n\r\nGo to AWS Console \u2192 IAM \u2192 Policies \u2192 Create Policy\r\nSelect JSON and use this policy document:\r\n\r\njsonCopy{\r\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\r\n    \"Statement\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n            \"Action\": [\r\n                \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\r\n                \"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Resource\": [\r\n                \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:secret:*\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nName it something like \"SecretsManagerReadAccess\"\r\n\r\n### Create the IAM Role:\r\n\r\nGo to IAM \u2192 Roles \u2192 Create Role\r\nChoose your use case:\r\n\r\nFor EC2: Select \"AWS service\" and \"EC2\"\r\nFor Lambda: Select \"AWS service\" and \"Lambda\"\r\nFor other services: Choose appropriate trust relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nAttach the policy you just created (\"SecretsManagerReadAccess\")\r\nName the role (e.g., \"SecretsManagerRole\")\r\n\r\n\r\n### Get the Role ARN:\r\n\r\nAfter creating the role, click into it\r\nCopy the \"Role ARN\" from the summary section\r\nIt will look like: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SecretsManagerRole\r\nThis is what you'll put in your .env file as AWS_ROLE_ARN\r\n\r\n\r\n### If you're using this with EC2:\r\n\r\nAttach this role to your EC2 instance\r\nGo to EC2 \u2192 Select instance \u2192 Actions \u2192 Security \u2192 Modify IAM Role\r\nSelect the role you created\r\n\r\n\r\n### For local development:\r\n\r\nYou'll need AWS credentials configured locally\r\nUse aws configure with credentials that can assume this role\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your new ENV could look like this:\r\nAWS_REGION=us-east-1\r\nSECRET_NAMES=secret/ropAIrito\r\nAWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::[REPLACE WITH YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER WITHOUT THE BRACKETS]:role/secrets-access-role \r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT TO NOTE**: You can use the .env just how it has normally been used in the Eliza repo. This is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nSecurity change / cleanup / ease of use\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nJust think it is more secure to pull from secrets manager, especially if people are hosting their agent on AWS, but this will work even if you host elsewhere as long as you have the a service role with secrets manager access specified in the \"AWS_ROLE_ARN\".\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMaybe just an explainer that Secrets Manager is useable with Eliza.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb09a61-fb4e-457a-8209-9eb7e6d53eca)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ddcd2b7-8fce-4e0c-8c90-a25af4ce5d3f)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a286a34-b560-4adb-b633-acb6a1209969)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd96be74-4966-41a2-babc-7e4c625bdbbe)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/166014ea-9185-4bb0-b2d7-433c5ac50e25)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nTake a look at settings.ts in the core package. \r\n\r\n### Discord Username\r\n\r\nropirito",

In `.env`, should set the value for `TREASURE_ADDRESS` (public address for the agent account), `TREASURE_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key for the same account), and `TREASURE_RPC_URL` as https://rpc.treasure.lol.\r\nTo test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. [Treasure Bridge](https://bridge.treasure.lol/) can be used to bridge MAGIC directly from `arb1` to an address on `treasure`.\r\n2. Run the agent and prompt it with: \"Send 0.1 MAGIC to \" - e.g. \"send 0.1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\"\r\n3. Assuming you had 1 MAGIC to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. \"Successfully sent 1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\r\nTransaction: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Treasure Block Explorer (https://treasurescan.io/)",

            "body": "# Pull Request: Integrate Deva into Eliza\r\n\r\n## Relates to\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new [Deva](https://www.deva.me/) client integration for the Eliza AI agent, enabling posting and scheduling posts to the [Deva](https://www.deva.me/) feed.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n- **Minimal Risk**: This integration is additive and does not alter existing functionalities of Eliza.\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Introduces a new dependency on Deva's API, which requires monitoring for future updates or changes.\r\n- **Data Privacy**: Ensures that any data shared between Eliza and Deva complies with our privacy policies.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the capability to post and schedule content directly to the [Deva platform](https://www.deva.me/) from the Eliza AI agent. Users can now seamlessly integrate their Eliza-generated content with [Deva](https://www.deva.me/), enhancing their content distribution and engagement strategies.\r\n\r\n### What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Feature**: This is a non-breaking change that adds new functionality to the Eliza AI agent by integrating with Deva\u2019s API for posting and scheduling content.\r\n\r\n## Documentation Changes Needed?\r\n\r\nNot at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Create a Deva Account**\r\n    - Navigate to [deva.me](https://www.deva.me/), create an account, and press the \"Get Started\" button in the top right.\r\n    - ![Get Started](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a31ebe01-3ee7-40f5-8e30-f59c79c642fe)\r\n\r\n2. **Complete Onboarding**\r\n    - Click through the onboarding screens and connect your preferred social account (e.g., Twitter) to Deva.\r\n\r\n3. **Access the Deva Feed**\r\n    - You can now see the Deva feed, where you can post and interact with other Devas.\r\n    - <img width=\"1462\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63a95b6e-779a-4864-b37c-5a848bde4c52\" />\r\n\r\n4. **Create an Application to get the token**\r\n    - At this point, you'll be able to get a token to interact with Deva, to do so: \r\n        - Navigate to Apps chapter in settings by clicking the user icon in top right corner and then settings -> Apps, or opening [apps](https://www.deva.me/settings/apps)\r\n        - Press Apps and Session\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fda36ac-3675-4f30-8c48-9b91e71a741e)\r\n        - Press Create new app\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fc9b04-510e-4a90-876c-e4f6d2e562d7)\r\n        - You are redirected to the form of the app creation, Name, Redirect URL and descriptions are necessary fields. Permissions are preselected and they are exactly enough for Eliza agent to post a message in feed.\r\n        - After creating an app, select it from the list of apps;\r\n        - Inside you will find a Get Token button, to generate a new token for your app:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/307ab088-0508-496e-bc8e-4ded833e8b4f)\r\n        - Later, it'll be visible in the list:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39034c0d-3cf3-4a69-aaab-8cd1740d9ba6)\r\n\r\n5. **Update Environment Variables**\r\n    - Once you have the token, update the environment variables in the `.env` file:\r\n      ```env\r\n      DEVA_API_KEY=YourApiKey\r\n      DEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.deva.me # Production API URL\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n6. **Select Deva Client as Default Character**\r\n    - Select the Deva client as Eliza's default character and choose the desired model:\r\n      <br/>![Select Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1120ebb4-4618-4364-bbf8-7040b6bda8c0)\r\n\r\n7. **Run the Application**\r\n    - Execute the following commands to install dependencies and start the application:\r\n      ```bash\r\n      pnpm install && pnpm start\r\n      ```\r\n    - This will initiate the Deva client:\r\n      <br/>![Initiate Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef64f0b-c2c1-4a4b-a6b5-0461433af022)\r\n    - Fetch the persona associated with your agent and the posts that you have pushed to the Deva feed:\r\n      <br/>![Fetch Persona and Posts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a698b06-b616-47cc-8318-355a91cc424c)\r\n    - Once done, Eliza will post one message to the Deva feed immediately and schedule another one as a test message:\r\n      <br/>![Post Messages](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523d69f4-1f3f-4d49-82a1-163e3cd4d128)\r\n8. **Eliza agent's post is in the feed!**\r\n   - <img width=\"621\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bd7cd5-7e3a-4c64-9597-9b0909642189\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### Staging Environment Testing\r\n\r\nTo avoid populating the production Deva feed, you can perform the same flow in the [staging environment](https://staging.deva.me/). Ensure you update the related environment variable:\r\n\r\n```env\r\nDEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api-staging.deva.me # Staging API URL\r\n",

This should be removed so that character card bios can be updated upon restart.  There's not much of a performance gain from caching anyway, as the bio is only loaded once on startup.\r\n\r\ntwitter login Cookies are also cached indefinitely, not sure if that's good or bad, but it doesn't seem right to me as twitter login cookies should eventually expire.",

It doesn't seem to like posts, repost or quote.\n\nUsing main I can get it to post quotes but it posts them in JSON format. No matter what I do I cannot seem to remove the formatting. It also still tweets even with explicit instructions not to.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nA clear and functional system for configuring what actions the agent can take on twitter or some helpful direction on configuration.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nNew to everything (Building ai agents, working with typescript, GitHub, etc.)",

It includes methods for initializing the database, handling errors, and executing queries.\r\n\r\n    Schema Initialization:\r\n        During the init method, the adapter checks if certain tables exist and attempts to initialize the schema by executing SQL scripts. This is where the extension setup might be happening.\r\n\r\n    Potential Issue:\r\n        If the vector extension is being created in the schema initialization process and it already exists, it would lead to the duplicate key error you're seeing.\r\n\r\nRecommended Steps:\r\n\r\n    Check Schema Files:\r\n        Review the schema.sql file in the adapter-postgres package to see if there are any CREATE EXTENSION commands for the vector extension. Ensure that these commands are wrapped in a conditional check to prevent re-creation if the extension already exists.\r\n\r\n    Modify Initialization Logic:\r\n        Update the initialization logic to check for the existence of the extension before attempting to create it. This can be done using a query like:\r\n\r\n        DO $$ BEGIN\r\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector') THEN\r\n                CREATE EXTENSION vector;\r\n            END IF;\r\n        END $$;\r\n\r\n    Database Cleanup:\r\n        As a temporary workaround, manually drop the vector extension from your database and let the initialization process recreate it. Use the following command in your PostgreSQL database:\r\n\r\n        DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS vector;\r\n\r\n"

            "body": "# Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to extend Eliza's capabilities with FerePro Agent. FerePro is an agent developed by [FereAI](https://www.fereai.xyz) which can perform open world Q&A related to various crypto topics like - Token Research, Investment Decisions, KOL research, category research, actions (swap, trade and more). It can interpret and answer questions of various complexities. We believe that adding this as a plugin will significantly improve Eliza's capabilities to perform research and Q&A.\r\n\r\n# Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA Plugin for FerePro in Eliza's codebase.\r\n\r\n# Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs an alternate, we will need to add a lot of tools and multi agentic capabilities to Eliza. FerePro can abstract all of that. \r\nDisclaimer: I'm a co founder and core dev at FereAI.\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n1. FerePro APIs can provide streaming answer as well as non streaming answer. This plugin must support both the use cases.\r\n2. FerePro APIs also provide a bunch of intermediate responses. This is usually shown in UI for users to get a view of happenings behind the scenes. They should only be enabled when this plugin is run in debug mode. Developers can use this info to troubleshoot or get support from Fere team.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n1. Developers will need to [get API keys from FereAI](https://docs.fereai.xyz/docs/api/api_access). \r\n3. This key must be passed to the plugin for it to work.\r\n4. FerePro is a freemium API. There is a limit on questions that can be asked for free. (We can revise the limits based on community feedback). For extended use cases, the developers must top up their account by visiting fereai.xyz.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "When I run the bot using `npm start`, everything works perfectly: it tweets and responds to tagged tweets as expected. However, when I run the bot inside Docker, I encounter the following issues:\r\n\r\nEnvironment Variable: The `OPENAI_API_KEY ` is required when running the bot in Docker (`docker compose up`) , but it's not needed when running it directly (without Docker).\r\n\r\nTweeting: The bot tweets without any issues when running in Docker.\r\n\r\nResponse to Tagged Tweets: The problem arises when the bot is supposed to respond to tweets it's tagged in. While it tweets fine, it doesn't respond to any tagged tweets.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve checked the logs, and everything seems normal\u2014there are no visible errors.\r\n\r\nCould anyone help identify what might be causing this issue when running the bot inside Docker?",

            "body": "## Description\r\nWhile setting up Discord bots with multiple characters, I encountered and resolved an issue with Discord token resolution. This could be valuable documentation for other developers.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe Discord client was failing with the following error:\r\n```\r\nError [TokenInvalid]: An invalid token was provided.\r\n    at WebSocketManager.connect (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/websocket/WebSocketManager.js:136:26)\r\n    at Client.login (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/Client.js:228:21)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was happening even though the tokens were correctly set in the `.env` file. The issue was in how the tokens were being resolved from environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI fixed this by:\r\n\r\n1. Ensuring proper token resolution in `eliza/packages/client-discord/src/index.ts`:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Get the token using runtime's getSecret\r\nconst token = this.character?.settings?.secrets?.DISCORD_API_TOKEN;\r\n\r\n// If it's a variable reference (${...}), resolve it from environment\r\nif (token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}')) {\r\n    const envVarName = token.slice(2, -1);\r\n    this.apiToken = process.env[envVarName] || '';\r\n} else {\r\n    this.apiToken = token || '';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Adding debug logging to track token resolution:\r\n```typescript\r\nelizaLogger.debug('Token resolution debug:', {\r\n    characterName: this.character.name,\r\n    rawToken: token,\r\n    isEnvVar: token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}'),\r\n    envVarName: token?.startsWith('${') ? token.slice(2, -1) : null,\r\n    envValue: token?.startsWith('${') ? process.env[token.slice(2, -1)] : null\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Points\r\n1. Character files should reference environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"secrets\": {\r\n            \"DISCORD_API_TOKEN\": \"${DISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE}\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `.env` file should contain the actual tokens:\r\n```env\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE=actual_token_here\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JUAN=actual_token_here\r\n```\r\n(where Julie and Juan are agents names)\r\n\r\n3. The token resolution process:\r\n   - First checks character's settings.secrets\r\n   - If the value is a variable reference (${...}), resolves it from environment\r\n   - Otherwise uses the raw value\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTo verify the fix:\r\n1. Ensure tokens are correctly set in `.env`\r\n2. Run the bot with both characters:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --characters=\"characters/julie.character.json,characters/juan.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n3. Check debug logs for token resolution process \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI suggest:\r\n1. Adding this documentation to the main repository\r\n2. Possibly including it in the official docs under a \"Troubleshooting\" or \"Configuration\" section\r\n3. Adding debug logs to help other developers diagnose similar issues\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like me to create a PR with these changes. ",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen defining a `twitterShouldRespondTemplate` in a character\u2019s JSON configuration file, the code attempts to invoke it as a function with `(validTargetUsersStr)`. Since JSON cannot store JavaScript functions, this causes runtime errors. Other templates like `twitterMessageHandlerTemplate` and `twitterPostTemplate` are handled purely as strings, so they work fine. The inconsistency leads to broken response generation when a JSON-defined `twitterShouldRespondTemplate` is present.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. **Create a character JSON file** (e.g., `adam.character.json`) that includes:\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"your-character-name\",\r\n        \"clients\": [\"telegram\", \"twitter\"],\r\n        \"modelProvider\": \"openai\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"secrets\": {\r\n                \"TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\": \"your_telegram_bot_token\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_USERNAME\": \"user\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_EMAIL\": \"email@proton.me\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_PASSWORD\": \"your_twitter_password\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_COOKIES\": \"[{\\\"key\\\":\\\"auth_token\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_auth_token\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"ct0\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_ct0_value\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"guest_id\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"v1%3A173451270913595996\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}]\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\": \"user1,user2\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        \"plugins\": [\r\n            \"@ai16z/plugin-your-custom-plugin\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"templates\": {\r\n            \"twitterPostTemplate\": \"# Areas of Expertise\\n{{knowledge}}\\n\\n# About {{agentName}} (@{{twitterUserName}}):\\n{{bio}}\\n{{lore}}\\n{{topics}}\\n\\n{{providers}}\\n\\n{{characterPostExamples}}\\n\\n{{postDirections}}\\n\\n# Task: Generate a post in the voice and style and perspective of {{agentName}} @{{twitterUserName}}.\\nWrite a 1-3 sentence post that is {{adjective}} about {{topic}} (without mentioning {{topic}} directly), from the perspective of {{agentName}}.
