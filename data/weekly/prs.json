    "title": "Opacity Verifiable Interference zkTLS Plugin",
    "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

    "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

Potential risks include:\r\n\r\n- **Dependency Resolution Changes:** Updates might lead to different versions of dependencies being installed, which could introduce unforeseen issues.\r\n\r\n- **Build or Runtime Errors:** If updated dependencies have breaking changes, they might cause build failures or runtime errors.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file by running `pnpm install -r --no-frozen-lockfile`. This command installs dependencies recursively across all workspaces and refreshes the lockfile to reflect any changes in dependencies.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Updates:** This is a non-breaking change that updates the lockfile to ensure it accurately represents the current state of dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nUpdating the lockfile ensures that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the project can be built and run consistently across different environments.

The parts involving other modules will be submitted later. For now, please review this plugin first.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nWhat does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin for fetching Twitter data reliably and efficiently. It addresses the limitations of using personal Twitter accounts for scraping, such as rate limits and account bans, by leveraging a proven solution that has already processed millions of requests on Apify.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change is this?\r\n<!-- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) Improvements (misc. changes to existing features) Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality) Updates (new versions of included code) -->\r\nFeatures: Adds a new plugin for Twitter data fetching.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. --><!-- ## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work? -->\r\nAI agents require large amounts of high-quality, timely data to function effectively. The intelligence of an AI agent depends on two key factors:\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the underlying AI model.\r\n\r\nThe quality, quantity, and timeliness of the data it processes.\r\n\r\nUsing personal Twitter accounts for scraping data poses significant risks, including account bans and rate limits. This plugin provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution for fetching Twitter data, which has already been validated through millions of executions on Apify.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am offering free usage credits to help developers get started quickly and contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed?\r\nI added a new environment variable and have updated the documentation in all relevant languages. I also explained the purpose of this variable.\r\nTWITTER_API_IO_KEY=\r\n#A third-party Twitter API key for data retrieval. This shared key is for testing only - get your personal key at https://twitterapi.io to avoid QPS limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\nIn the `src/tests` directory under my newly added component folder, you can find all the unit tests for the APIs. I ran the command `pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test` and confirmed that all unit tests passed successfully.\r\n\r\nDetailed testing steps\r\n`pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test`\r\n\r\nVerify that the plugin can fetch Twitter data without login.\r\n\r\nTest the plugin's performance under high concurrency.\r\n\r\nEnsure the plugin handles rate limits and errors gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscord username: [kaitoeasyapi]\r\nTwitter: [kaitoEasyApi](https://x.com/kaitoEasyApi)\r\nApify Twitter Actor: https://apify.com/kaitoeasyapi/twitter-x-data-tweet-scraper-pay-per-result-cheapest\r\n\r\n",

It modifies the tokenizer logic to handle the specific tokenization patterns and configurations required for the `o1` model.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nIncluding support for the `o1` model aligns with expanding the capabilities of `js-tiktoken` to handle the latest OpenAI models. This ensures broader usability and aligns with ongoing support for new model releases.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- My changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n- Updated README to include details on `o1` model support.\r\n- Added an entry to the changelog to document the feature addition.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing changes in the tokenizer logic in `src/tokenizer.js` and the associated test cases in `tests/tokenizer.test.js`.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository and check out the branch containing this PR.\r\n2. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date.\r\n3. Execute tests with `npm test` and verify that all test cases pass.\r\n4. Manually test by tokenizing examples specific to the `o1` model and comparing output against expected results.\r\n\r\nExample manual test:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { encode } = require('js-tiktoken');\r\nconst model = 'o1';\r\nconst input = 'Hello, this is a test.';\r\nconsole.log(encode(input, model));\r\n",

Which on subsequent messages, would trigger the callback to respond to the same message multiple times.\r\n\r\nWhere the continue action is meant for a natural flow of thoughts to keep generating, on normal back and forth convo's it would duplicate response.\r\n\r\nFix below now stops that as it takes into consideration its own message it just responded to, and how it framed to either not respond again, or continue a thought as it was intended.\r\n\r\n---TESTING Screen Record---\r\n1st section shows a previous double response, which is triggered by the question the agent asked to the user, which in turn triggers a double response on the next reply from the user\r\n\r\n2nd section shows continue being triggered as normal, but not triggering another response in the handler callback since it already responded. This will still allow continue to allow the agent to \"continue\" a thought it had as it was intended, also, per the examples.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ed92c8f-dc99-4c3b-95fc-9c0052f56197\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nninja_dev\r\n",

Review the plugin's architecture in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/index.ts`\r\n2. Check the market making strategy implementation in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/strategies/simple-market-making.ts`\r\n3. Review type definitions and configuration interface in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/types.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`\r\n2. Configure Hummingbot instance details in your character config:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"plugins\": [\"@eliza/plugin-hummingbot\"],\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"HUMMINGBOT_CONFIG\": {\r\n      \"instance\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"http://localhost:15888\",\r\n        \"apiKey\": \"your-api-key\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates the **FereAI APIs** using the `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK` module and update the **FerePro Plugin**, enhancing functionality to handle `ChatResponse` objects with better granularity. The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the integration of the `fereai-provider` in the `package.json` and the configuration of the required environment variables. Then, examine the updates made to `packages/core/src/generation.ts`, `packages/core/src/models.ts`, `packages/core/src/types.ts` and the `agent/src/index.ts` handlers under API configurations to understand the response handling.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables**:  \r\n   - Ensure that `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` are correctly set in the environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Run `pnpm add` to install the new `fereai-provider` module.\r\n\r\n3. **Run Unit Tests**:  \r\n   - Execute the `fereai-provider` test suite to verify that all existing and new tests pass successfully.\r\n   - For `fereai-provider` tests, refer to the [fereai-provider tests](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider/blob/main/packages/fereai/src/fereai.test.ts).\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing**:  \r\n   - Interact with the chatbot to ensure that responses are handled correctly and that the integration with FereAI APIs functions as expected using `fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Monitor logs to confirm that structured logging is operational and that no errors related to the new integration occur.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

    "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, we observed issues with aixbt, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Reclaim as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Reclaim is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nUpdates \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating **Reclaim** as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zero-knowledge proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-reclaim README.\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Proof Verification Example\r\nBelow is a screenshot showcasing the generated proof and its verification process:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 39 17 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c64b01-47b1-4ece-8624-9b65e7624f66\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 31 20 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41d675e-9249-4c46-9f12-396f02b7d8b2\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure the following environment variables (generated from the [Reclaim Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)):\r\n```\r\n# Reclaim Protocol\r\nRECLAIM_APP_ID= # Reclaim App ID\r\nRECLAIM_APP_SECRET= # Reclaim App Secret\r\n\r\n# Verifiable Inference Configuration\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_ENABLED=true # Set to true to enable verifiable inference\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=reclaim # Options: reclaim, opacity (soon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run a character using the command:\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"`\r\n\r\n3. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n4. Interact with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- Automated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n- No database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n--> Gajesh#0000\r\n",

    "body": "# Risks\r\nLow. Existing users who relied on Deepgram by default will still see no change unless they explicitly define a new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`. Fallback logic preserves original behavior (Deepgram → OpenAI → Local).\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- **Adds** an optional `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` setting (`deepgram`, `openai`, or `local`) with fallback logic.  \r\n  - If not set, old behavior remains: Deepgram → OpenAI → Local.\r\n- **Moves** Twitter Spaces plugins from `agent-twitter-client` into this repo for better flexibility and less friction in plugin development.\r\n- **Introduces** an AI-driven Twitter Spaces flow:\r\n  1. **Automatic** Space launch decisions (random chance, business hours, cooldown intervals).\r\n  2. **Multi-speaker** logic with queue management (`maxSpeakers`).\r\n  3. GPT-based filler/idle messages, optional STT/TTS bridging, local audio recording.\r\n  4. Graceful shutdown and cooldown for repeated Spaces.\r\n\r\n### Transcription Service Changes\r\n- We introduced a new **`TranscriptionProvider` enum** (`Deepgram`, `OpenAI`, or `Local`) to replace string flags.\r\n- In `initialize()`, the **provider is chosen in this order**:\r\n  1. `character.settings.transcription` (if the API keys exist),\r\n  2. `.env` (`TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`),\r\n  3. Old fallback logic (Deepgram → OpenAI → Local) if neither is configured.\r\n- For example, in your `character.json`, you can specify:\r\n  ```json5\r\n  {\r\n    // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n      \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  If you have `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set, the service will use Deepgram; otherwise it continues to the next check.\r\n- `processQueue()` uses a `switch` on `this.transcriptionProvider` to pick the final method (`transcribeWithDeepgram`, `transcribeWithOpenAI`, or `transcribeLocally`).\r\n\r\n## Flow Recap\r\n1. **Periodic Check**  \r\n   - If no Space is running, possibly launch one by `shouldLaunchSpace()` (random chance, business hours, cooldown).  \r\n   - If a Space is running, `manageCurrentSpace()` handles speaker timeouts, occupancy updates, queue acceptance, etc.\r\n\r\n2. **Space Creation**  \r\n   - Generates a `SpaceConfig` (topics from config or GPT).  \r\n   - Attaches plugins: audio recording, STT/TTS, idle monitor, etc.  \r\n   - Hooks into `speakerRequest`, `occupancyUpdate`, `idleTimeout`, etc.\r\n\r\n3. **Speaker Logic**  \r\n   - Maintains an `activeSpeakers` array + a queue if at capacity (`maxSpeakers`).  \r\n   - Enforces `speakerMaxDurationMs` per speaker.  \r\n   - If a speaker is removed, accept next in queue if available.\r\n\r\n4. **Stopping**  \r\n   - `stopSpace()` finalizes the Space, logs completion, clears states, etc.  \r\n   - Resumes periodic checks at a slower interval until the next launch is decided.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### A) `.env` / Environment Variables\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Transcription Provider\r\nTRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=         # Default is local (possible values: deepgram, openai, local)\r\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\r\nDEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### B) `character.json` → `\"twitterSpaces\"` Field\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n  }\r\n  \"twitterSpaces\": {\r\n    \"maxSpeakers\": 2,\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"Blockchain Trends\",\r\n      \"AI Innovations\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"typicalDurationMinutes\": 45,\r\n    \"idleKickTimeoutMs\": 300000,\r\n    \"minIntervalBetweenSpacesMinutes\": 60,\r\n    \"businessHoursOnly\": true,\r\n    \"randomChance\": 0.3,\r\n    \"enableIdleMonitor\": true,\r\n    \"enableSttTts\": true,\r\n    \"enableRecording\": false,\r\n    \"voiceId\": \"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\",\r\n    \"sttLanguage\": \"en\",\r\n    \"gptModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\r\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful AI co-host assistant.\",\r\n    \"speakerMaxDurationMs\": 240000\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **`maxSpeakers`**: number of concurrent speakers allowed.\r\n- **`topics`**: if none are provided, GPT generates them dynamically.\r\n- **`randomChance`**: probability for each check cycle to spawn a new Space.\r\n- **`speakerMaxDurationMs`**: maximum time each speaker can speak before removal.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Features** (new Twitter Spaces integration and optional transcription provider).\r\n- **Improvements** (unified plugin development, more config options, fallback logic maintained).\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, minimal. We must mention:\r\n- The new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (optional).\r\n- The new `twitterSpaces` config section in `character.json`.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Check `transcription.service.ts` to review how it resolves conflicts by prioritizing character settings, then `.env`, then old fallback.\r\n- Check new or relocated Twitter Spaces integration files for the Space lifecycle (launch, speaker management, idle detection, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Define `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (or leave it empty to keep old fallback).\r\n2. Provide valid API keys if choosing `deepgram` or `openai`.\r\n3. Define `twitterSpaces.randomChance` in the character JSON to `1` (for a 100% rate of starting a space).\r\n4. Run the agent; verify that Spaces launch automatically, respect the chosen transcription provider, and handle multi-speaker logic as expected.\r\n\r\nNo special database migrations are needed. Basic local runs and logs confirm correct functioning.\r\n\r\n# Future Improvements\r\n\r\n- **More robust decision logic** for accepting speakers, switching, and timeouts.  \r\n- **Realtime API plugin** for smoother, on-the-fly conversation handling.  \r\n- **Solo Broadcast Mode**: launch Spaces focused on a single host monologue with no external speakers.  \r\n- **True VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** to detect when a speaker finishes talking, instead of relying on manual mute/unmute cues.  \r\n- **Advanced scheduling triggers** (e.g., event-based or calendar-based).  \r\n- **Analytics & insights** for post-Space summaries or usage metrics.\r\n\r\n---",

I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.  I know there is alot of interest in the memory system as well so as part of the core it should be as clear as possible IMHO."

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nNo\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n**Low**\r\n- Adjustments to database queries improve performance by moving sorting and limiting logic to the database side.\r\n- Even though this change adds improvements to the Postgres adapter and required a change in the global `IDatabaseAdapter`, other database adapters are still working because the `limit` parameter is optional.\r\n- Other plugins relying on the `getMemoriesByRoomIds` function can opt into the `limit` functionality, but it is not necessary.\r\n- No breaking changes introduced.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR improves the performance of memory-fetching functionality by:\r\n- Moving sorting and slicing logic from the application layer to the database layer.\r\n- Adding an optional `limit` parameter to restrict the number of results fetched from the database.\r\n- Adjusting the runtime logic to leverage the new database query functionality.\r\n\r\n## Why was this change made?\r\nIn our database with **60,000 memories**, fetching memories by room IDs took **40 seconds**, significantly affecting the performance of the agent. After applying this fix, the query execution time dropped to just **0.02 seconds**. This improvement was observed using Supabase analytics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Changes to existing functionality to improve database query performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts` to understand how sorting and limiting were implemented in the database query.\r\n- Look at the adjusted runtime logic in `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` for the integration of the `limit` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Ensure all existing tests for memory fetching pass.\r\n2. Manually test the memory-fetching feature by:\r\n   - Querying with and without the `limit` parameter.\r\n   - Verifying that the sorting order (`createdAt DESC`) is maintained.\r\n3. Monitor query performance with larger datasets to confirm improvements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n- Updated query logic to include `ORDER BY createdAt DESC` and optional `LIMIT` in the PostgreSQL adapter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nI will attach screenshots of:\r\n- Successful working run with Postgres and SQLite.\r\n- Successful linting results.\r\n\r\n### Using Postgres adapter\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1054\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 13 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3606a21a-6933-402b-ae7d-d24ecb6a1263\" />\r\n<img width=\"1126\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 15 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b8a289-1cae-4a2f-9493-25cf79dc2d4b\" />\r\n\r\n### Using SQLite adapter\r\n<img width=\"1087\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 16 57 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a7f49f4-9880-4d4a-9586-d9548fda7dd5\" />\r\n<img width=\"543\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 18 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e04f844-ab14-44e3-a7f4-2601a853af46\" />\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 28 45 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82b35cad-c73a-46d0-b52c-5b1e05d87388\" />\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 29 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857b593f-f9e4-4774-a44a-358ea26155d8\" />\r\n",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8. Please let me know if anything is broke when you test it, it worked well on my end.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Shaiw Talks like Shaw\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/241b9420-8a6c-4115-ba73-7438bba91156)\r\n\r\n### Casual Conversation\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2b4a44-da93-4c80-902d-284222855811)\r\n\r\n### More\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adbf96ba-6f0b-4f58-8714-2fbc048b962e)\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nCaution: the docs site is crawled and inserted into vectordb on launch, each time you load the agent, this will happen. During testing, I suggest using cleanstart startup script, to wipe the database.  In production, this will need to be managed through db, if new pages are loaded.  This may need fixed in future to make this easier to manage.\r\n\r\n<!--  Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n## Database changes\r\nNeed to change from sqlite, to the database you use in test/production.\r\n\r\n<!--  If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n## Discord username\r\naah8098 (Allen)\r\n",

I've added the necessary comma so the code functions as intended.\r\n\r\nHere’s the fix I applied:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nenum ModelClass {\r\n    SMALL,    // Fast, efficient for simple tasks\r\n    MEDIUM,   // Balanced performance and capability\r\n    LARGE,    // Most capable but slower/more expensive\r\n    EMBEDDING // Specialized for vector embeddings\r\n    IMAGE     // Image generation capabilities\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nenum ModelClass {\r\n    SMALL,    // Fast, efficient for simple tasks\r\n    MEDIUM,   // Balanced performance and capability\r\n    LARGE,    // Most capable but slower/more expensive\r\n    EMBEDDING, // Specialized for vector embeddings\r\n    IMAGE     // Image generation capabilities\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis minor adjustment ensures that the values are properly separated in the enum, preventing potential issues down the line.",

Client App:\r\n- Added image display support in the chat interface\r\n- Implemented image upload functionality\r\n- Enhanced UI to handle image messages\r\n\r\n2. Client Direct:\r\n- Implemented image attachment handling in the `/:agentId/message` POST endpoint.\r\n- Added static file hosting for the direct client so that generated images and uploaded images can be displayed in the client.\r\n\r\n3. Plugin Node:\r\n- Added a `describeImage` Action in the plugin to take advantage of the `ImageDescriptionService` in the same plugin.\r\n- Modified `recognizeWithOpenAI` and `requestOpenAI` to accept local files, similar to how the first frame of .gif files is converted to a buffer and sent over the API\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. `packages/plugin-node/src/services/image.ts` - Core image processing service\r\n2.

    "title": "Feat: support TEE logging and support running eliza in Intel SGX",
    "body": "<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copy and pasting relevant items out of the html comments. -->\r\n\r\n# Relates to: \r\nKeywords: TEE, Intel SGX, Logging, Attestation, Verification, Gramine.\r\n\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section is to be filled out before final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces support for TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) logging and enables the Eliza application to run within Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions).\r\n\r\nAs Eliza is a fully autonomous AI agent capable of running within a TEE, we need to demonstrate to the outside world that we are indeed operating within a TEE. This allows external parties to verify that our actions are protected by the TEE and that they are entirely executed by Eliza, without any third-party interference. Therefore, it is necessary to leverage TEE's remote attestation and establish a TEE logging mechanism to prove that these operations are entirely and autonomously performed by Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the existing plugin-tee only supports running Eliza in dstack TDX CVM. However, although TDX is more convenient to use, Intel SGX remains a highly popular TEE in production environments. With the help of Gramine LibOS, it is possible to support running Eliza in SGX, thereby enabling the deployment of Eliza in a broader range of TEE scenarios.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n1. Support running Eliza in SGX\r\n2. Add plugin-sgx to support SGX attestation \r\n3. Add plugin-tee-log to support TEE logging (Gramine SGX and Dstack TDX)\r\n4. Add REST API in client-direct to support retrieve TEE logs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n## TEE Logging Mechanism:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Key Pair Generation and Attestation**:\r\n   - During startup, each agent generates a key pair and creates a remote attestation for the public key. The private key is securely stored in the TEE's encrypted memory. The agent's relevant information, along with the public key and attestation, is recorded in a local database. A new key pair is generated each time the agent is updated or restarted to ensure key security.\r\n\r\n2. **Log Recording**:\r\n   - For each log entry, basic information is recorded, including `agentId`, `roomId`, `userId`, `type`, `content`, and `timestamp`. This information is concatenated and signed using the agent's corresponding private key to ensure verifiability. The verification process follows this trust chain:\r\n     - Verify the attestation.\r\n     - Trust the public key contained in the attestation.\r\n     - Use the public key to verify the signature.\r\n     - Trust the complete log record.\r\n\r\n3. **Data Storage**:\r\n   - All log data must be stored in the TEE's encrypted file system in production environments. Storing data in plaintext is prohibited to prevent tampering.\r\n\r\n4. **Log Extraction for Verification**:\r\n   - Third parties can extract TEE logs for verification purposes. Two types of information can be extracted:\r\n     - **Agent Information**: This includes the agent's metadata, public key, and attestation, which can be used to verify the agent's public key.\r\n     - **Log Information**: Required logs can be extracted, with the agent's attestation and public key used to verify the signature, ensuring that each record remains untampered.\r\n\r\n5. **Integrity Protection**:\r\n   - When users extract TEE logs via the REST API, the results are hashed, and an attestation is generated. After extraction, users can verify the attestation by comparing the hash value contained within it to the extracted results, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeed to add new documentation about TEE logging and how to run Eliza in SGX\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. SGX Gramine support\r\n2. plugin-sgx\r\n3. plugin-tee-log\r\n4. other parts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n### Test SGX support\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to prepare the SGX environment and install the Gramine dependencies according to https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\r\n\r\nThen, start eliza in SGX:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npnpm i\r\npnpm build\r\n\r\n# Start default character\r\nSGX=1 make start\r\n# Start specific character\r\nSGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/trump.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test TEE logging\r\n\r\nTo get started, prepare the TEE environment. Both dstack TDX and Gramine SGX are supported.\r\n\r\nNext, enable TEE logging by configuring the .env file:\r\n```\r\nENABLE_TEE_LOG=true \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logging isn't integrated for actions by default, you need to integrate the logging for the actions you want to log. For example, if you want to log the `Continue` action of plugin-bootstrap, you can do the following:\r\n\r\nFirst, add plugin-tee-log to the dependencies of plugin-bootstrap:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"@elizaos/plugin-tee-log\": \"workspace:*\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, add the following code to the `Continue` action:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {\r\n    ServiceType,\r\n    ITeeLogService,\r\n} from \"@elizaos/core\";\r\n\r\n\r\n// In the handler of the action\r\n    handler: async (\r\n        runtime: IAgentRuntime,\r\n        message: Memory,\r\n        state: State,\r\n        options: any,\r\n        callback: HandlerCallback\r\n    ) => {\r\n        // Continue the action\r\n\r\n        // Log the action\r\n        const teeLogService = runtime\r\n            .getService<ITeeLogService>(ServiceType.TEE_LOG)\r\n            .getInstance();\r\n        if (teeLogService.log(\r\n                runtime.agentId,\r\n                message.roomId,\r\n                message.userId,\r\n                \"The type of the log, for example, Action:CONTINUE\",\r\n                \"The content that you want to log\"\r\n            )\r\n        ) {\r\n            console.log(\"Logged TEE log successfully\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Continue the action\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

In my tests, running Eliza smoothly in SGX requires configuring 64GB of EPC memory. Such a large memory footprint is caused by some indirect dependencies of Eliza on WASM. WASM requests a significant amount of memory during initialization, and configuring a smaller memory size will result in OOM (Out of Memory) errors.\r\n\r\nI will soon update a detailed step-by-step guide for running Eliza in SGX.\r\n"

        "body": "> SGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/c3po.character.json\"\r\n\r\nHi, I tested it in SGX using a clean project and have added a quick start guide for running it in SGX.\r\n\r\nDuring the following steps, the only issue I encountered was a build error caused by the missing plugin-tee dependency in plugin-tee-log. This error can be resolved by simply running the build command again. However, this is an issue that needs to be addressed later.\r\n\r\nOther than that, everything worked smoothly during the test. If you encounter any other issues while following these steps, please feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\nNote: Currently, I have set the SGX EPC size (memory size) to 64 GB in the Gramine manifest. In reality, Eliza itself does not require this much memory. However, some dependencies of Eliza rely on WebAssembly (WASM), and initializing WASM demands a significant amount of memory. If the memory is insufficient, you may encounter the following error:\r\n\r\n`RangeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Out of memory: Cannot allocate Wasm memory for a new instance.`\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this issue, I configured the enclave size to 64 GB. This is a temporary workaround, and we need to optimize WASM memory usage in the future.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to prepare a SGX enabled machine.\r\n\r\nThen, you can use the following command to start a Gramine Docker container:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo docker run -it --name eliza_sgx \\\r\n    --mount type=bind,source={your_eliza_path},target=/root/eliza \\\r\n    --device /dev/sgx/enclave \\\r\n    --device /dev/sgx/provision \\\r\n    gramineproject/gramine:stable-jammy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter entering the docker, you can use the following command to prepare the Eliza environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Generate the private key for signing the SGX enclave\r\ngramine-sgx-gen-private-key\r\n\r\ncd /root/eliza/\r\n\r\n# Install nodejs and pnpm\r\n# Node.js will be installed at `/usr/bin/node`.\r\n# Gramine will utilize this path as the default Node.js location to run Eliza.\r\n# If you prefer to use nvm for installing Node.js, please ensure to specify the Node.js path in the Makefile, as the installation path for nvm is not `/usr/bin/node`.\r\napt update\r\napt install -y build-essential\r\napt install -y curl\r\ncurl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_23.x | bash -\r\napt install -y nodejs=23.3.0-1nodesource1\r\nnpm install -g pnpm\r\n\r\n# Build Eliza\r\npnpm i\r\n# The build may fail on the first attempt due to the missing `plugin-tee` dependency in `plugin-tee-log`. Simply run the build command again to resolve the issue.\r\n# TODO: fix the build issue\r\npnpm build\r\n\r\n# Copy the .env.example file to .env\r\ncp .env.example .env\r\n# Edit the .env file\r\n\r\n# Start Eliza in SGX\r\nSGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/c3po.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n"

This is how choosing the action replies on Twitter works when the agent would like, re-tweet, Quote, or reply. \n\nIf I want a template to do conditional logic that executes 100% correctly, like a calculation, it would be beneficial, but maybe it's better to add tools for that case.\n\nFrom my point of view, this starts to approach a customized agent direction that requires new builds every time you add new logic. But if it doesn't break all templates w/ the new type accepting strings, then this can be useful.\n\nSome questions:\n- Does this require also editing all the other templates among the different clients as well?\n- Can we expand on the doc to make sure devs understand how to implement this?"

It simply introduces the possibility to pass a function that will resolve the template string. For me, this improves the developer experience by allowing developers to more easily customize their agents, and I’m personally a fan of using function resolvers when building SDKs.\n\nI updated the related documentation I could find, but I may have missed something."

    "title": "feat: Add Solana liquid staking support",
    "body": "Add the ability of liquid staking to the current elizaos solana plugin.\r\n\r\n- It can build the desired staking requests for end-users, eliminating the complexity of front-end development and the need for users to switch between multiple platforms to compare APYs and select staking protocols.\r\n- Currently supports five protocols: \"jito\", \"blaze\", \"jpool\", \"marinade\", \"marginfi\", and is capable of expanding to support more protocols.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1434\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- There are no risks. An independent new Solana feature module has been introduced without modifying the code of other parts.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- There are some distinctive liquid staking solutions on Solana. However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n- The StakeProtocolProvider uses the [Solana LST data provider](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/solana-lst-data-provider) open-sourced by stafiprotocol to provide data support. You can choose to use the default Stafi API or deploy it yourself.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Enable @elizaos/plugin-solana in the character.\r\n2. Interact with the Agent, for example: “My address is HqvTPqS2FaB2fQ7mxqZHQHz6H28o1u2Z9fRH5No8JN2W and I want to stake 0.01 SOL”.\r\n3. Obtain the response (the constructed staking transaction).",

    "title": "feat: suppress initial message from action",
    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nfeature: Suppressing initial response messages for specific actions in direct client\r\n\r\nI would like to also extend the twitter client to include this kind of functionality. Right now there is a lot of assumptions about agent behavior such as sending an initial message before an action is processed. Ideally during the upgrade to v2 some of these hard coded behaviors can be addressed. The design should be more conducive to plugin-defined emergent behavior. Maybe there's a discussion to be had at how we can go about this at a lower level rather than going client-by-client to implement this behavior. I'm still relatively new to Eliza community if anyone has groups or public discussions on this.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Changes only affect the direct client's message handling logic.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds support for suppressing initial response messages in the direct client when actions have `suppressInitialMessage` flag set to true. Some actions might not want to send a message until after the action is completed. Now the action will have to manually send a follow up message with the callback.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (changes to existing message handling features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNew property in the `Action` documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Check the modified message handling logic. I've changed `imageGeneration` action to include `suppressInitialMessage` to true for testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create an action with `suppressInitialMessage: true`\r\n2. Send a message to the direct client that triggers this action\r\n3. Verify only the callback message is sent, not the initial response\r\n\r\nKey test cases:\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: true` should only send callback message\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: false` or undefined should send both initial and callback messages\r\n- Action callback functionality should work the same regardless of suppression setting\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n```typescript\r\n                // Check if we should suppress the initial message\r\n                const action = runtime.actions.find(\r\n                    (a) => a.name === response.action\r\n                );\r\n                const shouldSuppressInitialMessage =\r\n                    action?.suppressInitialMessage;\r\n\r\n                const _result = await runtime.processActions(\r\n                    memory,\r\n                    [responseMessage],\r\n                    state,\r\n                    async (newMessages) => {\r\n                        message = newMessages;\r\n                        return [memory];\r\n                    }\r\n                );\r\n\r\n                if (!shouldSuppressInitialMessage) {\r\n                    if (message) {\r\n                        res.json([response, message]);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        res.json([response]);\r\n                    }\r\n                } else {\r\n                    if (message) {\r\n                        res.json([message]);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        res.json([]);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe changes ensure that when an action has `suppressInitialMessage` set to true:\r\n1. The initial response message is not sent in the API response\r\n2. The action's callback message is still sent if present\r\n3. The response array only includes the callback message",

This shift will scale message traffic astronomically, analogous to the web’s rise in the 2000s. Just as Cloudflare and https secured web traffic, messaging will need robust scalable end-to-end encrypted messages to protect sensitive information.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nRisks of not using end-to-end encryption for agent interactions exposes the users to what is called as Man in the **Middle Attacks**.\r\n\r\n> **Man in the Middle Attacks**: Intercept requests in between to alter or manipulate data sent or received by the AI service\r\n\r\n- **Phishing**: Messages can be intercepted and manipulated.\r\n- **Privacy**: Sensitive information read by unwanted parties\r\n- **Tampering**: Content can be altered without detection.\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> More concrete sensitive data could include credit card details, private keys and passwords which is not yet widely spread but as agents become smarter more use cases will include this type of sharing.\r\n\r\n## XMTP\r\n\r\nEliza agents come with a ready to use client that uses XMTP providing end-to-end encrypted messaging for every agent intereaction, crucial for privacy, security, and compliance provided by the XMTP network.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n\r\n- **E2EE**: End to end encrypted MLS encryption\r\n- **Multi-agent**: Support multi-agent through group chats\r\n- **Interoperable**: Works across all platforms and frontends\r\n- **Scalable**: Decentralized, open-source\r\n- **Anonymous**: By default every identity is ephemeral and anonymous.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nInstall the `xmtp` package\r\n\r\n```bash [cmd]\r\nbun install xmtp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis is how you can use the `xmtp` package to create an agent and handle messages.\r\n\r\n- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: This will encrypt all messages and make it available through its public address or ens domain.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { XMTP } from \"xmtp\";\r\n\r\nconst xmtp = new XMTP(onMessage, {\r\n    encryptionKey: WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY,\r\n});\r\nawait xmtp.init();\r\nconst onMessage = async (message, user) => {\r\n    console.log(`Decoded message: ${message.content.text} by ${user.address}`);\r\n    // Your AI model response\r\n    await xmtp.send({\r\n        message: response,\r\n        originalMessage: message,\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information visit XMTP [website](https://xmtp.org/)",

Removes the hard-coded `model class` from `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse`.  \r\n  2. Use the parameter to specify the desired model type.  \r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- **Risk Level**: Low  \r\n  - The change is confined to the internal logic of the `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse` function.  \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- Previously, `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse` did not allow dynamic model switching based on incoming parameters, limiting flexibility and making it cumbersome to use different models in various scenarios.  \r\n- By removing the hard-coded approach, developers can easily specify or configure the desired model without modifying core code.\r\n\r\n# What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- [x] **Bug fix** (fixes a reported issue)  \r\n- [ ] New feature (adds functionality)  \r\n- [ ] Other (please describe)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes  \r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Look at how `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse` now handles the incoming model parameter, and verify that any calling code is appropriately updated to use this new parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps  \r\n- Call `generateText` and `generateMessageResponse` with a specific model parameter, confirming that it correctly switches to the chosen model.  \r\n",

    "body": "Add the ability of liquid staking to the current elizaos solana plugin.\r\n\r\n- It can build the desired staking requests for end-users, eliminating the complexity of front-end development and the need for users to switch between multiple platforms to compare APYs and select staking protocols.\r\n- Currently supports five protocols: \"jito\", \"blaze\", \"jpool\", \"marinade\", \"marginfi\", and is capable of expanding to support more protocols.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1434\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- There are no risks. An independent new Solana feature module has been introduced without modifying the code of other parts.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- There are some distinctive liquid staking solutions on Solana. However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Enable @elizaos/plugin-solana in the character.\r\n2. Interact with the Agent, for example: “My address is HqvTPqS2FaB2fQ7mxqZHQHz6H28o1u2Z9fRH5No8JN2W and I want to stake 0.01 SOL”.\r\n3. Obtain the response (the constructed staking transaction).",

I suggest trying to do use the following to test it locally: \r\n\r\n• Description: “act” is a command-line utility written in Go that lets you run your GitHub Actions workflows locally.\r\n• How It Works: It parses your workflow .yml files and simulates GitHub Actions events (push, pull_request, etc.) in Docker containers on your local machine.\r\n• Why It’s Good:\r\n\r\nGreat for quickly iterating on a workflow without having to push to a branch repeatedly.\r\nLets you see console output, debug logs, and environment variables as if you were running on GitHub.\r\n• Potential Drawbacks:\r\nNot all GitHub Actions are guaranteed to work seamlessly. Some might rely on GitHub-hosted runners or environment specifics that “act” may not perfectly replicate.\r\nYou need Docker installed locally.\r\n• How to Get Started Quickly:\r\nInstall Docker.\r\nInstall act (on macOS you can use Homebrew: brew install act, or grab the binary from the GitHub releases page).\r\nFrom your repository, run:\r\nact <event_name>\r\nFor example, act push or act pull_request.\r\nBy default, act uses a lightweight Docker image for its runner; for more complex workflows you might need:\r\nact <event_name> --medium or --workflows .github/workflows/<your_workflow.yml>\r\n"

IN the sprit of OpenSource I wanted to make sure it was available for the whole community to use as well. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nA small additional input to the documentation is required to make users aware of the additional functionality and how it can be actioned. \r\nSimilar to the Postgres set up just adding in the appropriate connection string to the .env file will action he change to start using MongoDB as the database. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

After that the agent should run as expected, saving memories as before. The reviewer can verify the saved data inside the MongoDB interface. \r\n \r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1.

The main risks are:\r\n- Failed tweets due to rate limiting or authentication issues\r\n- Potential for tweets that are too long (mitigated by automatic truncation)\r\n- No risk to existing functionality as this is an isolated plugin\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a Twitter plugin that enables posting tweets through the agent-twitter-client package. Key features:\r\n- Implements POST_TWEET action for sending tweets\r\n- Handles Twitter authentication via environment variables\r\n- Automatically truncates tweets that exceed character limits\r\n- Provides detailed error handling and logging\r\n- Supports dry run mode for testing\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Adds new Twitter posting capability\r\n- Uses the standalone agent-twitter-client package\r\n- Implements proper error handling and character limit enforcement\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n- Add Twitter plugin setup instructions\r\n- Document required environment variables:\r\n  - TWITTER_USERNAME\r\n  - TWITTER_PASSWORD\r\n  - TWITTER_EMAIL\r\n  - TWITTER_DRY_RUN (optional)\r\n  - TWITTER_2FA_SECRET (optional)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review `packages/plugin-twitter/src/actions/post.ts` for the main implementation\r\n2. Check error handling in postTweet function\r\n3. Review tweet composition logic in composeTweet function\r\n4. Verify environment variable handling\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Set up environment variables in `.env`:\r\n```bash\r\nTWITTER_USERNAME=your_username\r\nTWITTER_PASSWORD=your_password\r\nTWITTER_EMAIL=your_email\r\nTWITTER_DRY_RUN=false\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Test tweet posting:\r\n```bash\r\n# Start with dry run mode\r\nTWITTER_DRY_RUN=true pnpm dev\r\n\r\n# Test actual posting\r\nTWITTER_DRY_RUN=false pnpm dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Verify error handling:\r\n- Try posting a tweet > 180 characters (should truncate)\r\n- Try posting with invalid credentials (should show error)\r\n- Try posting with missing credentials (should validate)\r\n\r\n4. Check logging:\r\n- Verify credential validation logs\r\n- Check tweet content generation logs\r\n- Verify error messages are descriptive\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n- Requires agent-twitter-client package\r\n- Environment variables must be set for Twitter authentication\r\n- No database changes required",

    "title": "feat: add birdeye plugin",
    "body": "This is my first attempt to contribute to this project. I have been adding features and additional query capability for the Birdeye API and I think many other could benefit.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\n- plugin ecosystem and capabilities for accessing and querying Birdeye data API\r\n- [Expanding Birdeye thread](https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1318974518680748173)\r\n- possible overlap with: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1366\r\n\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- People who already have the BIRDEYE_API_KEY enabled could end up querying the endpoints more\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nThis pull request significantly enhances the Birdeye API integration within the AI agent framework by expanding its capabilities beyond basic query functionality. The proposed tools enable more comprehensive and versatile interactions with the Birdeye API, including data clearing and management features. These improvements provide the AI agents with a broader and more efficient toolkit for handling Birdeye API data, enhancing the overall flexibility and utility of the framework for developers and end-users. By extending the scope of the API integration, this contribution supports more robust and scalable solutions within the project.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds providers that represent all the different API endpoints available in the Birdeye API. By doing so, it ensures that when a user requests a specific type of data, the AI agent has a significantly higher likelihood of accessing and utilizing the relevant data in its response. This enhancement maximizes the agent’s ability to provide accurate and contextually rich answers, leveraging the full scope of the Birdeye API.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- net new plugin\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis API connection is critical for enabling the agent to perform research and analyze the dynamics of the ecosystem effectively. By integrating comprehensive access to all Birdeye API endpoints, this PR lays the groundwork for future enhancements and features that will further expand the agent's capabilities. This integration not only empowers the agent to deliver more insightful and accurate responses but also positions the framework for scalable growth and the addition of advanced functionalities in the future.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a document change is needed, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Yes, this will require the docs to be updated. I am happy to update the appropriate project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- Pull the branch\r\n- Enable plugin by setting the BIRDEYE_API_KEY\r\n- Utilize the web console as ask questions about onchain data. \r\n- Example prompts:\r\n-- give me a list of wallets on solana that i should be following\r\n-- tell me more about BbJgE7HZMaDp5NTYvRh5jZSkQPVDTU8ubPFtpogUkEj4\r\n-- what are the top gainers today\r\n-- what is the current price of HIPPO?\r\n-- what tokens are tredning today on sui? \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\nhttps://x.com/sunosuporno/status/1870967395780792741\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nTwo main things:\r\n1. Update `generateText` API to be able to pass through tool options to leverage the model's tool calling capabilities\r\n2. Update the GOAT plugin to use tool calling allowing it to perform complex onchain actions that require multiple steps. Now developers can define high level actions (swap, bet on Polymarket, stake, etc.) and GOAT will take care of handling each action (see the screenshots below)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nI have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo and build it\r\n2. Set up the `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` env variables\r\n3. Uncomment lines 70-72 in the `actions.ts` file in the GOAT plugin\r\n4. Prompt the agent with \"Swap 0.1 USDC for MODE using KIM in a single hop\"\r\n5. In the agent logs you should see all the different steps that the agent is making\r\n6. The tx should fail unless you have ETH and USDC in MODE :)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\nAgent can just do one function call so you need to specify the inputs like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11cec757-fdb1-43b8-affc-562380a38184)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After\r\nAgent can do multiple function calls in an action so inputs are more human friendly:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f80382c-f48f-4096-a2ab-a2cafa72477d)\r\n\r\nIn the background you can also log all the different tool interactions:\r\n<img width=\"630\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 16 24 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/627792d8-eeb7-4110-b2ef-33dd8c83f3da\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\naguspunk\r\n",

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\n1. Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241222%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241222T094432Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=1a5dd5544d9787bd4b80ce1fa9db82a9647389b7df93cfd2c0c41a3d7400e4b9)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

    "body": "### What this PR does\r\n\r\n1. **Adds comprehensive test coverage** for our `stringToUuid` function:\r\n    - Checks UUID format (length, hyphen placement, regex matching).\r\n    - Verifies version and variant bits (RFC 4122 compliance).\r\n    - Tests various inputs (numbers, Unicode, empty strings, edge cases).\r\n    - Ensures consistent, deterministic output.\r\n2. **Fixes the version bits** to properly label the UUID as “version 5”:\r\n    - Previously, we weren’t strictly setting the top nibble in `hashBuffer[6]` to `0x5`.\r\n    - This change enforces RFC 4122 compliance by setting `(hashBuffer[6] & 0x0f) | 0x50`.\r\n\r\n### Why this matters\r\n\r\n- **Correct RFC 4122 compliance**: We now correctly produce v5 UUIDs.\r\n- **Potentially breaking**: The new code produces different UUID strings for the same input (re-keys everything). Any stored references or comparisons to old UUIDs will no longer match.\r\n\r\n### Risks & Impact\r\n\r\n- **Risk**: Existing code/data relying on old UUIDs may break or create duplicates.\r\n- **Mitigation**: We can choose to:\r\n    1. Merge only the **tests** for now, keeping the existing UUID generation.\r\n    2. Merge the bit fix (and re-key), but accept the breaking change or plan a migration.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\n1. **(Option A)** Merge only the tests and skip the version-bit fix for now (to avoid re-keying).\r\n2. **(Option B)** Merge both tests and fix, but coordinate any needed data migration or accept re-keying.",

Version-Bit Fix — applies the change that correctly sets the version 5 bits, which would re-key existing data.\r\n\r\nSince the second part can be disruptive, I’d appreciate guidance or help on how best to handle existing data or references.

Assuming ~400 ms blocktimes, this amounts to 60 seconds. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?

    "body": "_sup fam, today i put in a few hours to extend the Eliza framework by adding some core trading functionality for on-chain solana bots. my focus was to create a set of tools that will allow agents to execute trades, manage risk, and pull critical data. here's what I added and worked on:_\r\n\r\n**What I Added/Completed Today:**\r\n\r\n1. nice_funcs.py:\r\n\r\n- Added a library of helpful functions tailored for Solana on-chain trading.\r\n- Functions now include position management, wallet holdings fetching, and other utilities to make trading more efficient.\r\n- This has been tested with my personal bots but should integrate well with Eliza’s architecture.\r\n\r\n2. bot.py:\r\n\r\n- Built a script that allows agents to perform trading actions such as:\r\n- Closing a position (action 0).\r\n- Opening a position (action 1).\r\n- Adding stop-loss logic (action 2).\r\n- Implementing breakout trades (action 3).\r\n- Market-making logic (action 5).\r\n- Currently, it uses basic user input to decide the action, but this will soon be fully bot-driven.\r\n\r\n3. get_ohlcv_data.py\r\n\r\n- this allows the agent to get open, high, low, close and volume data\r\n- also have moving averages and examples of other technical indicators\r\n\r\n4. dontshare.py (ignored):\r\n\r\n- Added placeholders for sensitive information such as:\r\n- Solana private keys.\r\n- BirdEye API keys.\r\n- RPC URLs.\r\n- Added this file to .gitignore to ensure it doesn’t get accidentally pushed.\r\n\r\n5. Updated README.md:\r\n\r\n- Wrote a comprehensive README to document how to use these new tools and scripts.\r\n- It includes detailed steps for configuration, usage, and what each action/script does.\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Why This Matters:**\r\n\r\n- These tools lay the groundwork for enabling AI agents to perform advanced trading strategies directly on-chain.\r\n- The added functionality simplifies interaction with Solana contracts while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.\r\n- It ensures agents can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention—just plug in the strategy, and they're good to go.\r\n\r\n**What's Next?**\r\n\r\n- I'm researching the best way to transition from Python to TypeScript or add a shell for TS compatibility, depending on the project direction.\r\n- Planning to integrate more trading actions like:\r\n- Funding buys (action 6).\r\n- Liquidation monitoring (action 7).\r\n- Always happy to hear feedback on how this integrates with Eliza’s current architecture and if there are specific improvements to focus on.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity to contribute. Let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to adjust or refine for tomorrow.",

Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1.

This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n \r\n# Detailed testing steps\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

But tested with clearing cache and cached, working great.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the .env variable TWITTER_COOKIES and simply uses twitterScraper to manage cookies on login better from cache.\r\n\r\nIt also removes the docs / readme step where user has to provide the JSON array of TWITTER_COOKIES.\r\n\r\nSide win: the looping try-catch while loop is cleaner to read, deleted many lines of code in simpler implementation for twitter auth.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nTWITTER_COOKIES env var is an added complexity not required, users have to go searching in dev-tools console `document.cookie` and rearrange their JSON and add to ENV. But, twitter-scraper client has support for login + fetch current cookies on it's own. It is a redundant ENV setup that can be removed to simplify the twitter agent setup process for all users.\r\n\r\nI recently implemented twitter-scapper-client in my own custom agent and never had todo this ENV setup, I saw it as a EZ win for Eliza community to port over.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have removed the TWITTER_COOKIES docs sections, full deletion, no longer needed.\r\n\r\nPlease show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba2b848b-2c47-4ba7-a3ca-7f3fa8172129)\r\n\r\nI also ran:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn await this.runtime.cacheManager.delete(\r\n    `twitter/${username}/cookies`\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo delete the cookies from cache manually to verify my code was working.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nRemove TWITTER_COOKIES from .env and see if Twitter agent boots correctly and works from fresh cache and already cached.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNone, automated tests are fine. \r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nRemove TWITTER_COOKIES from any CI / CD and .env test runners.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\ncjft\r\n",

This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. \n\n### Details\nI have exploited this vulnerability in a Windows service using version 5.22.11 of the module, to escalate privileges (in an environment where I am authorized to do so).

The implementation provides a reusable and scalable solution for caching data in the application by also implementing the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n\r\n**Implemented Features:**\r\n- `getCache`: Retrieves cached data for a given `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `setCache`: Caches data with a unique key constructed using `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `deleteCache`: Removes cached data for the specified `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- Proper error handling and logging for all Redis operations.\r\n- Integration with the `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` interface.\r\n\r\n**Code Highlights:**\r\n- A new `RedisClient` class implements the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n- The `buildKey` method ensures unique Redis keys for each agent and operation.\r\n- `ioredis` is used for efficient Redis interactions, supporting advanced Redis features like clusters and pipelines if needed in the future.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Provides a scalable and reusable caching solution.\r\n- Ensures clear separation of concerns and adheres to the existing interface.\r\n- Improves application performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe implementation has been tested for the following scenarios:\r\n- Successfully setting a cache entry.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that exists.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that does not exist.\r\n- Deleting a cache entry.\r\n- Handling Redis errors gracefully during operations.\r\n",

Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE.\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

    "title": "feat: AWS Secrets Manager Integration",
    "body": "# Relates to: AWS Secrets Manager Integration & Security\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nThis reduces risks by allowing offloading all API keys and secrets to Secrets Manager instead of leaving them raw in a .env\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nIn settings.ts in package/core, rather than just pulling from .env, it also grabs any secrets manager secret names you specify. You can STILL keep all your keys directly in .env, but if you specify \"SECRET_NAMES\" in your .env, it will pull secrets through that from AWS along with anything in the .env\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Create an AWS account. Free-tier is enough. \r\n2. In Secrets Manager, create a secret named \"secret/myagentname\" (this can be named anything but this format is nice). \r\n3. Add in all the keys you have in your .env currently as key value pairs in this secret and save.\r\n\r\n### IAM Role Setup:\r\nFirst, create an IAM Policy:\r\n\r\nGo to AWS Console → IAM → Policies → Create Policy\r\nSelect JSON and use this policy document:\r\n\r\njsonCopy{\r\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\r\n    \"Statement\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n            \"Action\": [\r\n                \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\r\n                \"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Resource\": [\r\n                \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:secret:*\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nName it something like \"SecretsManagerReadAccess\"\r\n\r\n### Create the IAM Role:\r\n\r\nGo to IAM → Roles → Create Role\r\nChoose your use case:\r\n\r\nFor EC2: Select \"AWS service\" and \"EC2\"\r\nFor Lambda: Select \"AWS service\" and \"Lambda\"\r\nFor other services: Choose appropriate trust relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nAttach the policy you just created (\"SecretsManagerReadAccess\")\r\nName the role (e.g., \"SecretsManagerRole\")\r\n\r\n\r\n### Get the Role ARN:\r\n\r\nAfter creating the role, click into it\r\nCopy the \"Role ARN\" from the summary section\r\nIt will look like: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SecretsManagerRole\r\nThis is what you'll put in your .env file as AWS_ROLE_ARN\r\n\r\n\r\n### If you're using this with EC2:\r\n\r\nAttach this role to your EC2 instance\r\nGo to EC2 → Select instance → Actions → Security → Modify IAM Role\r\nSelect the role you created\r\n\r\n\r\n### For local development:\r\n\r\nYou'll need AWS credentials configured locally\r\nUse aws configure with credentials that can assume this role\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your new ENV could look like this:\r\nAWS_REGION=us-east-1\r\nSECRET_NAMES=secret/ropAIrito\r\nAWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::[REPLACE WITH YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER WITHOUT THE BRACKETS]:role/secrets-access-role \r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT TO NOTE**: You can use the .env just how it has normally been used in the Eliza repo. This is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nSecurity change / cleanup / ease of use\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nJust think it is more secure to pull from secrets manager, especially if people are hosting their agent on AWS, but this will work even if you host elsewhere as long as you have the a service role with secrets manager access specified in the \"AWS_ROLE_ARN\".\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMaybe just an explainer that Secrets Manager is useable with Eliza.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb09a61-fb4e-457a-8209-9eb7e6d53eca)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ddcd2b7-8fce-4e0c-8c90-a25af4ce5d3f)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a286a34-b560-4adb-b633-acb6a1209969)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd96be74-4966-41a2-babc-7e4c625bdbbe)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/166014ea-9185-4bb0-b2d7-433c5ac50e25)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nTake a look at settings.ts in the core package. \r\n\r\n### Discord Username\r\n\r\nropirito",

This PR adds support for Eliza to interact with the Treasure mainnet, with logic/implementation borrowed from #1225 and #1128.\r\n\r\nInitially, only the `transfer` function has been supported with additional features to come to hook into the Treasure Development Kit (TDK), Magicswap, and other Treasure platform features.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nSpin up an agent with the `treasure` plugin + review `plugin-treasure`.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. In `.env`, should set the value for `TREASURE_ADDRESS` (public address for the agent account), `TREASURE_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key for the same account), and `TREASURE_RPC_URL` as https://rpc.treasure.lol.\r\nTo test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. [Treasure Bridge](https://bridge.treasure.lol/) can be used to bridge MAGIC directly from `arb1` to an address on `treasure`.\r\n2. Run the agent and prompt it with: \"Send 0.1 MAGIC to \" - e.g. \"send 0.1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\"\r\n3. Assuming you had 1 MAGIC to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. \"Successfully sent 1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\r\nTransaction: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Treasure Block Explorer (https://treasurescan.io/)",

On testnet, you can use the [Avail Faucet](https://faucet.avail.tools/).

Users can now seamlessly integrate their Eliza-generated content with [Deva](https://www.deva.me/), enhancing their content distribution and engagement strategies.\r\n\r\n### What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Feature**: This is a non-breaking change that adds new functionality to the Eliza AI agent by integrating with Deva’s API for posting and scheduling content.\r\n\r\n## Documentation Changes Needed?\r\n\r\nNot at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Create a Deva Account**\r\n    - Navigate to [deva.me](https://www.deva.me/), create an account, and press the \"Get Started\" button in the top right.\r\n    - ![Get Started](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a31ebe01-3ee7-40f5-8e30-f59c79c642fe)\r\n\r\n2. **Complete Onboarding**\r\n    - Click through the onboarding screens and connect your preferred social account (e.g., Twitter) to Deva.\r\n\r\n3. **Access the Deva Feed**\r\n    - You can now see the Deva feed, where you can post and interact with other Devas.\r\n    - <img width=\"1462\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63a95b6e-779a-4864-b37c-5a848bde4c52\" />\r\n\r\n4. **Create an Application to get the token**\r\n    - At this point, you'll be able to get a token to interact with Deva, to do so: \r\n        - Navigate to Apps chapter in settings by clicking the user icon in top right corner and then settings -> Apps, or opening [apps](https://www.deva.me/settings/apps)\r\n        - Press Apps and Session\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fda36ac-3675-4f30-8c48-9b91e71a741e)\r\n        - Press Create new app\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fc9b04-510e-4a90-876c-e4f6d2e562d7)\r\n        - You are redirected to the form of the app creation, Name, Redirect URL and descriptions are necessary fields. Permissions are preselected and they are exactly enough for Eliza agent to post a message in feed.\r\n        - After creating an app, select it from the list of apps;\r\n        - Inside you will find a Get Token button, to generate a new token for your app:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/307ab088-0508-496e-bc8e-4ded833e8b4f)\r\n        - Later, it'll be visible in the list:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39034c0d-3cf3-4a69-aaab-8cd1740d9ba6)\r\n\r\n5. **Update Environment Variables**\r\n    - Once you have the token, update the environment variables in the `.env` file:\r\n      ```env\r\n      DEVA_API_KEY=YourApiKey\r\n      DEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.deva.me # Production API URL\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n6. **Select Deva Client as Default Character**\r\n    - Select the Deva client as Eliza's default character and choose the desired model:\r\n      <br/>![Select Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1120ebb4-4618-4364-bbf8-7040b6bda8c0)\r\n\r\n7. **Run the Application**\r\n    - Execute the following commands to install dependencies and start the application:\r\n      ```bash\r\n      pnpm install && pnpm start\r\n      ```\r\n    - This will initiate the Deva client:\r\n      <br/>![Initiate Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef64f0b-c2c1-4a4b-a6b5-0461433af022)\r\n    - Fetch the persona associated with your agent and the posts that you have pushed to the Deva feed:\r\n      <br/>![Fetch Persona and Posts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a698b06-b616-47cc-8318-355a91cc424c)\r\n    - Once done, Eliza will post one message to the Deva feed immediately and schedule another one as a test message:\r\n      <br/>![Post Messages](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523d69f4-1f3f-4d49-82a1-163e3cd4d128)\r\n8. **Eliza agent's post is in the feed!**\r\n   - <img width=\"621\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bd7cd5-7e3a-4c64-9597-9b0909642189\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### Staging Environment Testing\r\n\r\nTo avoid populating the production Deva feed, you can perform the same flow in the [staging environment](https://staging.deva.me/). Ensure you update the related environment variable:\r\n\r\n```env\r\nDEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api-staging.deva.me # Staging API URL\r\n",

Trump says silly offensive stuff, and we wanted to capture that. He would not say SARS-COVID-19. I disagree with about 99% of the stuff he says, and 99% of the stuff his character file says. That being said, I care about art, and not letting art be compromised by politics.\r\n\r\nWe love people all over the world, and personally I will be visiting China in a couple days to meet everyone. I don't believe that we should be against any group for their nationality. But we shouldn't kill the comedy and make our characters worse-- that's why OpenAI's models suck now. It's a slippery slope that will reduce bravery, integrity and quality."
