    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow. \r\n- The caching mechanism in the wallet provider is isolated and uses a short TTL (5 seconds), which minimizes the impact on operations.\r\n- Changes to the transfer action align with existing types and state management, with no breaking changes expected.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces improvements and fixes to the EVM plugin:\r\n1. **Caching in Wallet Provider**: Implements a caching mechanism to store wallet balances for 5 seconds, reducing redundant calls and improving performance.\r\n2. **Align Transfer Action**: Removes unnecessary `template` field from the transfer action, aligning it with its intended type and improving clarity.\r\n3. **State Update on Transfers**: Enhances state updates by populating the state with recent messages for better transfer context.\r\n4. **Improved Transfer Template**: Refines the transfer template for valid JSON responses and clearer placeholders.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Features**: \r\n  - Added caching to the WalletProvider to reduce redundant operations.\r\n  - Improved transfer template for better JSON response handling.\r\n- **Performance**: \r\n  - Enhanced state updates in the transfer action for improved context handling.\r\n- **Bug Fixes**: \r\n  - Aligned transfer action to its intended type, removing unnecessary fields.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n- To improve the performance and maintainability of the EVM plugin that we use in production.\r\n- To ensure the transfer action operates in line with its intended functionality, reducing the risk of errors.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review changes in the wallet provider (`WalletProvider`) for caching logic.\r\n2. Examine the updated transfer action implementation to verify type alignment and state updates.\r\n3. Test the improved transfer template to ensure JSON responses are valid and placeholders function correctly.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Run unit tests for the wallet provider to verify caching functionality.\r\n2. Test the transfer action manually by asking an agent for a transfer and checking:\r\n   - Correct state updates.\r\n   - Valid and cached wallet balance in the state.\r\n   - Successful transaction.\r\n3. Verify the cache expiry behavior by observing multiple wallet balance fetches within and outside the 5-second TTL.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNo specific deploy instructions needed; automated tests and regular deployment process suffice.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n**nikita_zhou**\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Agent interaction\r\n\r\nLink to the tx: https://testnet.iotexscan.io/tx/f946fce5bc127761bd780444bf2d3180bf66fa4944b37e803767e99e76dd0d13\r\n\r\n<img width=\"755\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 12 25 34 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c765432-ced8-4944-b543-aa6dbc99d2c3\" />\r\n\r\n### Caching\r\n\r\n<img width=\"610\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 12 26 43 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfc17094-02d0-4b09-ba30-2018501d6277\" />\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n\r\n<img width=\"899\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-02 at 10 31 25 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb011bf-d84d-4550-99ef-4212b341265b\" />\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1122\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-02 at 10 20 39 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af098dac-2e22-4b0e-b6a1-540d8e8ebe9a\" />\r\n",

    "title": "Opacity Verifiable Interference zkTLS Plugin",
    "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n[Cloudflare's AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) provides logs for all prompt request responses , which are the target of the mpc-tls , ensuring that all AVS validators are performing MPC-TLS on the same date. \r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nBy writing the proof to `proof.json`, you can also verify using \r\n```sh\r\ncurl --location 'https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify' \\\r\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n--data @proof.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis invokes a shared mpc-tls session as listed in step 7. \r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",
