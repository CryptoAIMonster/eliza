    "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

This command installs dependencies recursively across all workspaces and refreshes the lockfile to reflect any changes in dependencies.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Updates:** This is a non-breaking change that updates the lockfile to ensure it accurately represents the current state of dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?

The parts involving other modules will be submitted later. For now, please review this plugin first.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nWhat does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin for fetching Twitter data reliably and efficiently.

The intelligence of an AI agent depends on two key factors:\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the underlying AI model.\r\n\r\nThe quality, quantity, and timeliness of the data it processes.\r\n\r\nUsing personal Twitter accounts for scraping data poses significant risks, including account bans and rate limits. This plugin provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution for fetching Twitter data, which has already been validated through millions of executions on Apify.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am offering free usage credits to help developers get started quickly and contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed?\r\nI added a new environment variable and have updated the documentation in all relevant languages. I also explained the purpose of this variable.\r\nTWITTER_API_IO_KEY=\r\n#A third-party Twitter API key for data retrieval. This shared key is for testing only - get your personal key at https://twitterapi.io to avoid QPS limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\nIn the `src/tests` directory under my newly added component folder, you can find all the unit tests for the APIs. I ran the command `pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test` and confirmed that all unit tests passed successfully.\r\n\r\nDetailed testing steps\r\n`pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test`\r\n\r\nVerify that the plugin can fetch Twitter data without login.\r\n\r\nTest the plugin's performance under high concurrency.\r\n\r\nEnsure the plugin handles rate limits and errors gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscord username: [kaitoeasyapi]\r\nTwitter: [kaitoEasyApi](https://x.com/kaitoEasyApi)\r\nApify Twitter Actor: https://apify.com/kaitoeasyapi/twitter-x-data-tweet-scraper-pay-per-result-cheapest\r\n\r\n",

So deployments will immediately fail with this error.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1496\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f127798-466b-416c-8f18-c4e7a81c9c97\" />\r\n\r\nThe deployment succeeds on this branch with the following configuration:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1496\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/495c4b7a-0c8b-44d3-b71b-c481cbe5d6c8\" />\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Validate that all references to NodeJS v23 have been updated across the codebase\r\n2. Validate that all CI checks pass\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Install Node.js v22 using nvm:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    nvm install\r\n    nvm use\r\n    ```\r\n2. Install pnpm:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\r\n    ```\r\n4. Install dependencies:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    pnpm install\r\n    ```\r\n5. Run the test suite to ensure compatibility\r\n6. Verify the development server starts correctly\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nlachiejames3677\r\n",

    "title": "Fix double spaced tweets in Post.ts",
    "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow risk, simply ensures tweets generated follow the prompt guidelines of double spaces (\\n\\n) for new statements instead of a single space to improve tweet readability. \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nUpdates the line break handling in the tweet formatting logic to follow the prompt stating to use double spaces between statements. Currently statements only use a single line break (\\n). This enforces the double line breaks for better readability in tweets. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis allows agents to tweet better-structured posts that are optimally formatted for readability. Also ensures posting follows the double space guideliens written out into the prompt. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nThe changes are in the generateNewTweet() function and the fixNewLines() helper within post.ts. \r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nGenerate a sample tweet using the updated code. \r\n\r\nVerify all escaped newlines (\\n) in the model's output are replaced with double linebreaks (\\n\\n).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n![Screenshot 2024-12-31 233257](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2148e11b-6993-4090-93de-4cbbd340cb54)\r\n![Screenshot 2024-12-31 233303](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a0c7c1e-ed21-4c4d-bbec-9878cb88ac3d)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n![Screenshot 2024-12-31 233502](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b0bd331-5084-4037-827d-22a15c0d70ef)\r\n![Screenshot 2024-12-31 233521](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c34ba669-d22a-4e5b-bd5b-e935158c4585)\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nsuicidal_goofy\r\n",
