This change adds a new API endpoint for fetching memories, which should not affect existing functionality.\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds a new API endpoint /agents/:agentId/:roomId/memories to fetch memories for a specific agent and room. This enhancement supports improved web-based chat capabilities with Eliza characters.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nMee.fun a hosted Eliza service, want to add a web-based chat UI.  In order to do this history of the chat needs to be retrievable.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation. The new API endpoint should be documented in the appropriate API documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the new route added in packages/client-direct/src/api.ts\r\n2. Check the structure of the response in the /agents/:agentId/:roomId/memories endpoint\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Start the server\r\n2. Use a tool like Postman or curl to make a GET request to /agents/{agentId}/{roomId}/memories, replacing {agentId} and {roomId} with valid IDs\r\n3. Verify that the response includes the correct structure with agentId, roomId, and an array of memories\r\n4. Check that each memory in the response includes all the fields from the Memory interface\r\n5. Test with invalid agentId to ensure a 404 response is returned\r\n6. Test with a valid agentId but no memories to ensure an empty array is returned\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\ntreppers\r\n",

The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.
