    "body": "_sup fam, today i put in a few hours to extend the Eliza framework by adding some core trading functionality for on-chain solana bots. my focus was to create a set of tools that will allow agents to execute trades, manage risk, and pull critical data. here's what I added and worked on:_\r\n\r\n**What I Added/Completed Today:**\r\n\r\n1. nice_funcs.py:\r\n\r\n- Added a library of helpful functions tailored for Solana on-chain trading.\r\n- Functions now include position management, wallet holdings fetching, and other utilities to make trading more efficient.\r\n- This has been tested with my personal bots but should integrate well with Eliza’s architecture.\r\n\r\n2. bot.py:\r\n\r\n- Built a script that allows agents to perform trading actions such as:\r\n- Closing a position (action 0).\r\n- Opening a position (action 1).\r\n- Adding stop-loss logic (action 2).\r\n- Implementing breakout trades (action 3).\r\n- Market-making logic (action 5).\r\n- Currently, it uses basic user input to decide the action, but this will soon be fully bot-driven.\r\n\r\n3. get_ohlcv_data.py\r\n\r\n- this allows the agent to get open, high, low, close and volume data\r\n- also have moving averages and examples of other technical indicators\r\n\r\n4. dontshare.py (ignored):\r\n\r\n- Added placeholders for sensitive information such as:\r\n- Solana private keys.\r\n- BirdEye API keys.\r\n- RPC URLs.\r\n- Added this file to .gitignore to ensure it doesn’t get accidentally pushed.\r\n\r\n5. Updated README.md:\r\n\r\n- Wrote a comprehensive README to document how to use these new tools and scripts.\r\n- It includes detailed steps for configuration, usage, and what each action/script does.\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Why This Matters:**\r\n\r\n- These tools lay the groundwork for enabling AI agents to perform advanced trading strategies directly on-chain.\r\n- The added functionality simplifies interaction with Solana contracts while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.\r\n- It ensures agents can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention—just plug in the strategy, and they're good to go.\r\n\r\n**What's Next?**\r\n\r\n- I'm researching the best way to transition from Python to TypeScript or add a shell for TS compatibility, depending on the project direction.\r\n- Planning to integrate more trading actions like:\r\n- Funding buys (action 6).\r\n- Liquidation monitoring (action 7).\r\n- Always happy to hear feedback on how this integrates with Eliza’s current architecture and if there are specific improvements to focus on.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity to contribute. Let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to adjust or refine for tomorrow.",

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\n1. Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n \r\n# Detailed testing steps\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

Minor risks include possible false positives or initial configuration errors, which can be addressed without impact to production workflows.\r\n\r\n# Background  \r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?  \r\nThis PR integrates **CodeQL Analysis** into the GitHub repository to enable automated security scanning of the codebase. CodeQL will analyze code for vulnerabilities, errors, and potential improvements across supported programming languages.  \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?  \r\n**Features** – Non-breaking change that adds security functionality.  \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?  \r\nTo improve code security and quality by automating the detection of vulnerabilities and providing actionable insights directly within GitHub. This aligns with best practices for secure DevSecOps workflows.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?  \r\n**My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.**\r\n\r\n# Testing  \r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?  \r\n- Review the **.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml** file to verify the CodeQL setup and configuration.  \r\n- Check the Security tab for CodeQL scan results after testing the workflow.  \r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps  \r\n1. Trigger the CodeQL workflow by pushing new code or opening a pull request.  \r\n2. Verify that the workflow completes successfully.  \r\n3. Confirm that the results are displayed under the Security tab of the repository.  \r\n4. Address any flagged issues and validate that resolved issues no longer appear in subsequent scans.  \r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes  \r\nNo special deployment instructions are needed. The workflow is self-contained within the repository configuration.\r\n\r\n## Database changes  \r\nNone.  \r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions  \r\nStandard GitHub Action setup: merge the PR and ensure the workflow is triggered by future commits or pull requests.  \r\n\r\n---  \r\nThis PR provides the foundation for continuous code security scanning using CodeQL and ensures our repository adheres to security best practices.

But tested with clearing cache and cached, working great.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the .env variable TWITTER_COOKIES and simply uses twitterScraper to manage cookies on login better from cache.\r\n\r\nIt also removes the docs / readme step where user has to provide the JSON array of TWITTER_COOKIES.\r\n\r\nSide win: the looping try-catch while loop is cleaner to read, deleted many lines of code in simpler implementation for twitter auth.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nTWITTER_COOKIES env var is an added complexity not required, users have to go searching in dev-tools console `document.cookie` and rearrange their JSON and add to ENV. But, twitter-scraper client has support for login + fetch current cookies on it's own. It is a redundant ENV setup that can be removed to simplify the twitter agent setup process for all users.\r\n\r\nI recently implemented twitter-scapper-client in my own custom agent and never had todo this ENV setup, I saw it as a EZ win for Eliza community to port over.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have removed the TWITTER_COOKIES docs sections, full deletion, no longer needed.\r\n\r\nPlease show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba2b848b-2c47-4ba7-a3ca-7f3fa8172129)\r\n\r\nI also ran:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn await this.runtime.cacheManager.delete(\r\n    `twitter/${username}/cookies`\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo delete the cookies from cache manually to verify my code was working.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nRemove TWITTER_COOKIES from .env and see if Twitter agent boots correctly and works from fresh cache and already cached.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNone, automated tests are fine. \r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nRemove TWITTER_COOKIES from any CI / CD and .env test runners.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\ncjft\r\n",

This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. \n\n### Details\nI have exploited this vulnerability in a Windows service using version 5.22.11 of the module, to escalate privileges (in an environment where I am authorized to do so). However, as far as I can see from the code, it is still present in master branch at time of writing, on line [403/404 of network.js](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/blob/3a92931c7d46605ffddc1aacb97a9727273b2888/lib/network.js#L403).\n\nThe SSID is obtained from `netsh wlan show interface ...` in `getWindowsWirelessIfaceSSID`, and then passed to `cmd.exe /d /s /c \"netsh wlan show profiles ...` in `getWindowsIEEE8021x`, without sanitization.\n\n### PoC\nFirst, the command injection payload should be included in the connected Wi-Fi SSID. For example create hotspot on mobile phone or other laptop, set SSID to payload, connect to it with victim Windows system. Two example SSID's to demonstrate exploitation are below.\n\nDemonstration to run ping command indefinitely:\n```\na\" | ping /t 127.0.0.1 &\n```\n\nRun executable with privileges of the user in which vulnerable function is executed. Chosen executable should should be placed in (assuming system drive is C): `C:\\a\\a.exe`.\n```\na\" | %SystemDrive%\\a\\a.exe &\n```\n\nThen, the vulnerable function can be executed on the victim system, for example, using:\n```\nconst si = require('systeminformation');\nsi.networkInterfaces((net) => { console.log(net) });\n```\n\nNow the chosen command, `PING.exe` or `a.exe` will be run through the cmd.exe command line.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>sebhildebrandt/systeminformation (systeminformation)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.23.8`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n### [`v5.23.6`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone UTC, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
