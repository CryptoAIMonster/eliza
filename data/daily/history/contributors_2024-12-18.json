Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, the logging mechanism in `/packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins` lacks detailed output, making it difficult to trace issues and monitor performance effectively.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nIntegrate the `elizaLogger` construct to provide more comprehensive logging throughout the codebase. This would involve:\n- Adding entry and exit logs for key functions.\n- Including detailed error logging with stack traces.\n- Logging significant state changes and data processing steps.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nConsidered using a third-party logging library, but `elizaLogger` offers a more integrated solution with existing infrastructure.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nUtilize existing examples of `elizaLogger` usage in other parts of the codebase as a reference. Extend these examples to cover more complex scenarios within the `/packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins` path.",
