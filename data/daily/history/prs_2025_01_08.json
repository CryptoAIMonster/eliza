    "body": "# Fix for Plugin Import Issues through Character file\r\n\r\n# Relates to\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n- Low risk - Changes only affect plugin import behavior\r\n- Impacts community-published plugins without default exports\r\n- No changes to core functionality or existing working plugins\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nIt was noticed while adding plugins to the character file, many plugins would fail and the agent would crash. This happened because the code is written to get default exports and many plugins are not doing so. They have named exports, which caused the imported plugin default to be undefined!  \r\n\r\nFixes plugin import mechanism to properly handle community-published plugins that don't use default exports. The changes:\r\n- Add proper error handling for failed imports\r\n- Support multiple plugin exports from a single file\r\n- Maintain backward compatibility with default exports\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\nBug fix - Resolves plugin import failures\r\n\r\n# Documentation Impact\r\nNo changes are needed to project documentation as this fixes implementation details without changing the public API.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where to start?\r\n1. Start with loadCharacters() function in src/[file].ts\r\n2. Focus on the plugin import logic changes\r\n3. Check error handling improvements\r\n\r\n## Testing Steps\r\n1. Test with a plugin using the default export\r\n   - Import should work as before\r\n   - Verify plugin loads correctly\r\n\r\n2. Test with community plugin (no default export)\r\n   - Create a test plugin with named exports\r\n   - Verify all valid plugins are imported\r\n   - Check console logs for proper import tracking\r\n\r\n3. Test with invalid plugin\r\n   - Verify graceful error handling\r\n\r\n# Discord Username\r\nbchief#0\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your review! Please let me know if you need any clarification.",

When inconsistencies are found, it fails the PR check and provides clear instructions to contributors on how to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n- Adds new CI workflow to improve development process\r\n- Helps prevent pnpm-lockfile related issues before PR gets merged to develop/main\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNo need.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the new workflow file: `.github/workflows/lockfile-check.yml`\r\n2. Check the workflow configuration and error messages\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create a test PR with an outdated lockfile:\r\n   - Modify a package.json file\r\n   - Don't run pnpm install\r\n   - Push changes\r\n   - Verify the workflow fails and provides clear instructions\r\n2. Update the lockfile:\r\n   - Run `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`\r\n   - Commit and push the updated lockfile as a chore\r\n   - Verify the workflow passes\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNo special deployment needed - workflow will be active as soon as it's merged to the target branch.\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\nStandard GitHub Actions workflow deployment - no additional steps required.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\njonathanesum",

These variables (XAI_MODEL,  XAI_API_KEY & IMAGE_GEN) are relics from legacy code that is no longer used. The only variable that was actually used is XAI_API_KEY for the Together API but it has its own api key variable so it's not actually needed at all. I also think it was creating confusion for some users thinking it was related to xAI, Grok or Twitter (also based on its location in env). I updated the docs/guides that include these variables but there are still a lot of translations that need to be updated. I did english and spanish.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nNo risk, only 1 line of actual code was altered (removed). The rest is all docs and the env.example file.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nRemoves unused variables\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFix or update\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why.
