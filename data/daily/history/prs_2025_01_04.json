This change only impacts bootstrap plugin and is disabled by default.  \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nShaw had a plan in #391 to enable operator instructions, such that agents can receive goals and knowledges automatically from conversations. Further, such capability is ideally extendable by templating. \r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR basically makes the original #391 work end to end. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n1. Add more meaningful logs to json parser.\r\n2. Fix the evaluator flow in #391 , making sure goals and knowledge can be generated and memorized. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis change enables template-based instructions for agents. FXN will iterate over it, and continue building agent-agent coordination on Eliza. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nOnly plugin-bootstrap is touched thus testable. Follow the steps below if needed. \r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Update operators in packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts by pasting your user id. \r\n2. `pnpm build && pnpm start`\r\n3. `pnpm start:client `\r\n4. Chat with Eliza agent and look for logs in cmd, as exampled below. \r\n<img width=\"1432\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 6 12 53 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afb368bf-db85-4238-a139-a222b8dff202\" />\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.
