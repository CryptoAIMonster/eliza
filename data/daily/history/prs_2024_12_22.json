    "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\n1. Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241222%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241222T094432Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=1a5dd5544d9787bd4b80ce1fa9db82a9647389b7df93cfd2c0c41a3d7400e4b9)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

Assuming ~400 ms blocktimes, this amounts to 60 seconds. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?

    "body": "\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nMedium risk: I don't know if neynar's APIs support long casts with 1024 length without any additional flags as I couldn't find the limit documented or if there are any other parameters except for `text` in their publishCast function. I don't have an account to test it. The value takes into consideration the byte length of the cast, so maybe unicode characters of 1024 length will fail.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nThe cast limit for farcaster client has been modified to match the [protocol's spec](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/blob/main/docs/SPECIFICATION.md#24-casts)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nI wanted it to match the spec instead of the currently incorrectly defined limit\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nI don't think there's any documentation for the Farcaster client at the moment\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nIf you have a neynar account try posting a cast with a message size of 1024 bytes\r\n",
