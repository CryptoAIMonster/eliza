    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nManaging contributions in an open-source project can be challenging, especially when it comes to efficiently categorizing and prioritizing incoming pull requests. Manually labeling each pull request based on the files changed or branch names is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays in reviews and potential contributor frustration.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nImplementing an automated labeling system using GitHub Actions, specifically the `actions/labeler` action, would streamline this process. By configuring a `.github/labeler.yml` file, we can define rules that automatically apply labels to pull requests based on criteria such as modified file paths or branch naming conventions. This automation ensures consistent labeling, accelerates the triage process, and allows maintainers to focus on meaningful code reviews.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- **Manual Labeling**: Continuing to label pull requests by hand, which is inefficient and susceptible to human error.\r\n\r\n- **Custom Scripts**: Developing bespoke scripts to handle labeling, which would require additional maintenance and might not integrate seamlessly with GitHub's ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nAutomated labeling enhances the contributor experience by providing immediate feedback on the categorization of their pull requests. It also aids in project management by ensuring that all contributions are appropriately tagged, facilitating better tracking and prioritization. Implementing this feature aligns with best practices for open-source project maintenance, promoting efficiency and encouraging more streamlined collaboration.\r\n\r\nFor more information on setting up the labeler action, refer to the official GitHub documentation:  ",

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMaintaining an open-source project involves managing numerous issues and pull requests. Over time, some of these become inactive or outdated, cluttering the repository and making it challenging to identify current and relevant items. Manually tracking and closing such inactive issues and pull requests is time-consuming and prone to oversight.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nImplementing an automated workflow using the `actions/stale` GitHub Action can streamline this process. This action would automatically mark issues and pull requests as stale after a specified period of inactivity and subsequently close them if no further activity occurs. This automation ensures that the repository remains organized, with outdated or inactive items systematically managed.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- **Manual Management**: Regularly reviewing and closing inactive issues and pull requests by hand. However, this approach is labor-intensive and may lead to inconsistencies or delays in addressing stale items.\r\n\r\n- **Custom Scripts**: Developing bespoke scripts to handle stale issues and pull requests. While feasible, this requires additional maintenance and may not be as robust or feature-rich as existing solutions like `actions/stale`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe `actions/stale` GitHub Action is a widely used tool for managing inactive issues and pull requests. It allows for customization of inactivity periods, messages, and labels, providing flexibility to adapt to the project's specific needs. Implementing this action can improve project maintenance efficiency and enhance contributor engagement by clearly indicating which items require attention.\r\n\r\nFor more information and configuration options, refer to the official `actions/stale` documentation:\r\n\r\n ",

This leads to potential vulnerabilities being overlooked until later stages of development or after deployment, increasing the risk of security breaches and technical debt. A streamlined solution for continuous code scanning and vulnerability detection is needed.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**  \r\nIntegrate **CodeQL Analysis** into the GitHub repository for automated security scanning. CodeQL should:\r\n1. Analyze code for vulnerabilities across supported languages (C, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.).\r\n2. Run scans automatically on new commits and pull requests.\r\n3. Generate detailed reports highlighting security risks and offering actionable remediation steps.\r\n4. Integrate results directly into GitHub's Security tab for easy visibility and tracking.  \r\n\r\nThis integration will ensure continuous monitoring and improve overall code security and quality.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**  \r\n1. **Manual Code Reviews**: Time-intensive and prone to human error, making it an unreliable substitute for automated tools.  \r\n2. **Third-party Tools (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk)**: These provide similar features but may involve additional configuration, costs, or lack the seamless integration with GitHub that CodeQL offers.  \r\n3. **Custom Scripts**: Writing custom scripts for static code analysis, which is resource-intensive and lacks the depth and support of CodeQL.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**  \r\n- CodeQL is free for public repositories and deeply integrated into GitHub, making it an ideal choice for this workflow.  \r\n- Example use case: Pull requests are automatically scanned, and developers are alerted to vulnerabilities before merging.  \r\n- Relevant documentation for setup: [[CodeQL GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors).  \r\n\r\nPlease prioritize this integration to enhance the security and reliability of our codebase.",

The solution should:\r\n\r\nFetch chart data, annotations, and other custom elements from TradingView via API.\r\nFormat the content appropriately for Twitter, including text captions for context and hashtags.\r\nProvide options to schedule or instantly post tweets from TradingView without switching between platforms.\r\nInclude settings for customization, such as default hashtags, watermarking charts, or adding predefined text templates.\r\nDescribe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nManual Process: Manually screenshotting charts and uploading them to Twitter, but this is inefficient and lacks automation.\r\nThird-party Tools: Using standalone apps like TweetDeck or social media managers, but these don't integrate with TradingView's annotations directly.\r\nCustom Scripts: Writing scripts to automate the TradingView-to-Twitter flow, but this requires significant development time and is not as user-friendly as a plugin-based solution.\r\nAdditional context\r\n\r\nTradingView provides an API that can retrieve chart data and render annotations, which can streamline integration.\r\nThe GOAT plugin already has a Twitter API integration, so extending its capabilities to include TradingView should be feasible.\r\nThis feature could significantly enhance the usability of both tools for traders and content creators.\r\nScreenshot or visual example of an ideal tweet with TradingView integration for reference:\r\n(Include a hypothetical example showing how a TradingView chart and description would appear in a tweet.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
