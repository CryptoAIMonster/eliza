        "body": "@lessuselesss love this PR, but there are some weird problems that will cause a NixOS user to fail when building the codebase with nix flakes enabled.\r\n\r\nFor example, I built this on my NixOS machine and we see this error:\r\n```\r\nWARN  Unsupported engine: wanted: {\"node\":\"23.3.0\"} (current: {\"node\":\"v20.18.1\",\"pnpm\":\"9.15.0\"})\r\ndocs                                     |  WARN  Unsupported engine: wanted: {\"node\":\"23.3.0\"} (current: {\"node\":\"v20.18.1\",\"pnpm\":\"9.15.0\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may think...what?! No Way...But how?? The pkgs specifically lists `nodejs_23` and when I run `node version` I will see the `v23.2.0`, but that still does not equal `v20.18.1`.\r\n\r\nSo I did some digging bc Nix can be a pain in the ass at times with weird dependencies errors. So I checked the `pnpm` pkgs source code and found this line https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/394571358ce82dff7411395829aa6a3aad45b907/pkgs/development/tools/pnpm/generic.nix#L28\r\n\r\nAnd `nodejs` pkg points to:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e258b67-924e-4471-a590-d7bde3ac7c64)\r\n\r\nSo this here is the culprit for why a NixOS user will hit this weird error even though we declaratively chose the right node version."
