    "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, we observed issues with aixbt, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Reclaim as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Reclaim is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nUpdates \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating **Reclaim** as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zero-knowledge proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-reclaim README.\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Proof Verification Example\r\nBelow is a screenshot showcasing the generated proof and its verification process:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 39 17 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c64b01-47b1-4ece-8624-9b65e7624f66\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 31 20 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41d675e-9249-4c46-9f12-396f02b7d8b2\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure the following environment variables (generated from the [Reclaim Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)):\r\n```\r\n# Reclaim Protocol\r\nRECLAIM_APP_ID= # Reclaim App ID\r\nRECLAIM_APP_SECRET= # Reclaim App Secret\r\n\r\n# Verifiable Inference Configuration\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_ENABLED=true # Set to true to enable verifiable inference\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=reclaim # Options: reclaim, opacity (soon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run a character using the command:\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"`\r\n\r\n3. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n4. Interact with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- Automated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n- No database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n--> Gajesh#0000\r\n",

It's planned to add Silent Payments support.\r\n\r\n## 🚀 Key Features\r\n\r\n- ⚡️ **Bitcoin Taproot Implementation**: Native Segwit v1 (P2TR) address generation for `onchain`.\r\n- 🌉 **Ark L2 integration**: Supports connecting to an Ark server for virtual transaction batching for `offchain`\r\n- 💸 **USD-denominated transaction support**\r\n    - Real-time fiat conversion\r\n    - Price-aware fee estimation\r\n- `onchain` UTXOs and `offchain` Virtual UTXOs coin selection\r\n\r\n- Automatic path selection (on-chain vs off-chain based on address)\r\n- Balance tracking across Bitcoin layers\r\n\r\n\r\n- 🔗 **Advanced URI Support**\r\n  - BIP21 URI generation and parsing\r\n    - Ark protocol endpoints\r\n    - Silent Payment addresses (coming soon)\r\n    - Amount specifications\r\n    - Network identification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔍 Risks & Mitigations\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Low\r\n\r\n## 🚦 Install\r\n\r\n1. Run the complete test suite:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   cd packages/plugin-bitcoin\r\n   pnpm test\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## 📋 Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Bitcoin functionality tested\r\n- [x] Ark protocol integration verified\r\n- [ ] Documentation updated with examples\r\n- [ ] Security review completed\r\n- [ ] Performance benchmarks passed\r\n- [x] BIP21 URI support validated\r\n- [x] USD denomination support tested",

    "body": "# feat: Twitter Spaces Integration\r\n\r\n**Discord**: `slkz.`\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces integration of **Twitter Spaces** into the AI agent, providing:\r\n- **Automatic** Space launch decisions (random chance, business hours, cooldown intervals, etc.).\r\n- **Multi-speaker** handling (configurable `maxSpeakers`).\r\n- **Speaker queue** management for overflow.\r\n- **GPT-based filler** messages (welcome, idle, closing, etc.).\r\n- Optional **plugins**: Idle monitor, TTS bridging (STT/TTS), and local audio recording.\r\n\r\nNo breaking changes are introduced beyond **adding** this new functionality and **updating** the `agent-twitter-client` to support advanced speaker logic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Flow Recap\r\n\r\n1. **Periodic Check**  \r\n   We call `startPeriodicSpaceCheck()`, typically with a dynamic interval.  \r\n   - **When no Space is running**: we do `shouldLaunchSpace()`, which decides whether to launch based on random chance, business hours, and a minimum cooldown.  \r\n   - **When a Space is running**: we call `manageCurrentSpace()` more frequently (e.g. every 20 seconds) to handle speaker timeouts, queue acceptance, occupancy changes, and potential stop conditions.\r\n\r\n2. **Space Creation**  \r\n   - We generate a `SpaceConfig` from either pre-set `charSpaces.topics` or GPT (if none are provided).  \r\n   - We instantiate a new `Space`, conditionally add:\r\n     - **RecordToDiskPlugin** (audio recording to disk).\r\n     - **SttTtsPlugin** (speech-to-text and text-to-speech bridging).\r\n     - **IdleMonitorPlugin** (idle detection).  \r\n   - We hook into events: `speakerRequest`, `occupancyUpdate`, `idleTimeout`, etc.\r\n\r\n3. **Speaker Logic**  \r\n   - We maintain an **array** of `activeSpeakers` and a **queue** for overflow if `activeSpeakers.length` hits `maxSpeakers`.  \r\n   - Each speaker is subject to `speakerMaxDurationMs`; upon exceeding it, we remove them (optionally speaking a filler message).  \r\n   - If a speaker is removed and the queue is **non-empty**, we accept the next queued request.  \r\n   - If more than `maxSpeakers` are active for any reason, we remove extras.\r\n\r\n4. **Stopping**  \r\n   - `stopSpace()` finalizes the Space, logs the time of completion (`lastSpaceEndedAt`), clears states, and sets `isSpaceRunning = false`.  \r\n   - The system then reverts to checking at a slower interval until we decide to launch a new Space again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### A) `.env` / Environment Variables\r\n\r\nIf you want to store GPT or ElevenLabs tokens:\r\n```bash\r\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\r\nELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...\r\n```\r\n### B) `character.json` → `\"twitterSpaces\"` Field\r\n\r\nBelow is an **example** JSON snippet for the `twitterSpaces` object in `character.json`:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n  \"twitterSpaces\": {\r\n    // Maximum simultaneous speakers (1 = single speaker, 2+ = multi)\r\n    \"maxSpeakers\": 2,\r\n\r\n    // Array of predefined topic strings\r\n    // If empty, we use GPT to generate some\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"Blockchain Trends\",\r\n      \"AI Innovations\"\r\n    ],\r\n\r\n    // Max overall duration (in minutes) for the Space\r\n    \"typicalDurationMinutes\": 45,\r\n\r\n    // Idle threshold in ms (e.g., 300000 = 5 minutes)\r\n    \"idleKickTimeoutMs\": 300000,\r\n\r\n    // Minimum interval (minutes) before launching another Space\r\n    \"minIntervalBetweenSpacesMinutes\": 60,\r\n\r\n    // If true, only launch between 9:00-17:00 UTC\r\n    \"businessHoursOnly\": true,\r\n\r\n    // Probability (0.0 - 1.0) at each check\r\n    \"randomChance\": 0.3,\r\n\r\n    // Flags to enable or disable specific plugins\r\n    \"enableIdleMonitor\": true,\r\n    \"enableSttTts\": true,\r\n    \"enableRecording\": false,\r\n\r\n    // TTS / GPT config (e.g., for ElevenLabs)\r\n    \"voiceId\": \"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\",\r\n    \"sttLanguage\": \"en\",\r\n    \"gptModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\r\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful AI co-host assistant.\",\r\n\r\n    // Max speaking time (ms) for each speaker\r\n    \"speakerMaxDurationMs\": 240000\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key Fields**:\r\n- **`maxSpeakers`**: 1 for single-speaker style, or higher to allow multiple.  \r\n- **`topics`**: if empty, GPT auto-generates.  \r\n- **`idleKickTimeoutMs`**: triggers `idleTimeout` if no audio detected for that duration.  \r\n- **`randomChance`**: probability for each check to spawn a Space.  \r\n- **`speakerMaxDurationMs`**: automatically remove a speaker after this many ms.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Potential Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Audio Message Queue**: Manage TTS outputs in a queue to avoid overlapping messages.  \r\n- **Knowledge Storage**: Gather insights from Space interactions and store them as knowledge or memory afterwards.  \r\n- **Speaker-less Spaces**: Optionally launch Spaces without external speakers, functioning as “TED talk” monologues or scheduled broadcasts.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- This is our **first** official integration of Twitter Spaces, not an upgrade from a previous version.  \r\n- **No Breaking Changes** expected outside the new `agent-twitter-client` version.  \r\n- For questions, you can reach me on Discord: `slkz.`\r\n\r\nThank you!",
