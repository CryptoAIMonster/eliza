This change only impacts bootstrap plugin and is disabled by default.  \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nShaw had a plan in #391 to enable operator instructions, such that agents can receive goals and knowledges automatically from conversations. Further, such capability is ideally extendable by templating. \r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR basically makes the original #391 work end to end. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n1. Add more meaningful logs to json parser.\r\n2. Fix the evaluator flow in #391 , making sure goals and knowledge can be generated and memorized. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis change enables template-based instructions for agents. FXN will iterate over it, and continue building agent-agent coordination on Eliza. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nOnly plugin-bootstrap is touched thus testable. Follow the steps below if needed. \r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Update operators in packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts by pasting your user id. \r\n2. `pnpm build && pnpm start`\r\n3. `pnpm start:client `\r\n4. Chat with Eliza agent and look for logs in cmd, as exampled below. \r\n<img width=\"1432\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 6 12 53 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afb368bf-db85-4238-a139-a222b8dff202\" />\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

    "body": "\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc61632d-90f4-4576-9817-6e693ce2b6c4)\r\n\r\n# CoinMarketCap Plugin for Eliza\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nLow - This is an additive change that introduces a new plugin without modifying existing functionality. The main risks are:\r\n\r\n- Rate limiting from CoinMarketCap API (Stricter limits compared to CoinGecko)\r\n- Potential timeout issues when the API is slow\r\n- Invalid cryptocurrency symbols causing failed requests\r\n- Cost implications as CoinMarketCap API is a paid service\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- Adds a new CoinMarketCap plugin for cryptocurrency price checking\r\n- Implements a `GET_PRICE` action that fetches current prices using the v1 API\r\n- Provides TypeScript types and interfaces for CoinMarketCap API responses\r\n- Includes environment validation for API key configuration\r\n- Adds proper error handling for API calls and symbol validation\r\n\r\n### What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality):\r\n\r\n- New plugin implementation\r\n- New paid API integration\r\n- New TypeScript types and validation\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n\r\n- Add CoinMarketCap plugin setup instructions\r\n- Document required API key configuration\r\n- Add usage examples for price checking\r\n- Update plugin list in main documentation\r\n- Add pricing/rate limit considerations\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the plugin implementation in `/plugin-coinmarketcap/src/`\r\n2. Check the main action implementation in `index.ts`\r\n3. Verify API service in `service.ts`\r\n4. Review type definitions in `types.ts`\r\n5. Check template handling in `template.ts`\r\n\r\n### Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Set up environment:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run agent locally and test natural language queries:\r\n   - \"What's the current price of Bitcoin?\"\r\n   - \"Show me ETH price in USD\"\r\n   - \"Get the price of SOL\"\r\n\r\n3. Verify error handling:\r\n   - Try with invalid symbols\r\n   - Test API timeout scenarios\r\n   - Check rate limit handling\r\n   - Verify currency conversion handling\r\n\r\n## Future Expansion\r\n\r\n### 1. Extended CoinMarketCap Integration\r\n\r\n- Add support for all available cryptocurrencies\r\n- Include market data (market cap, volume, supply)\r\n- Add historical price data\r\n- Support multiple currency conversions\r\n- Implement proper rate limit handling\r\n\r\n### 2. Additional API Features\r\n\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/map` - Add support for symbol/id mapping\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/info` - Include detailed crypto metadata\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/listings/latest` - Add market data sorting and filtering\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/categories` - Support category-based queries\r\n- `/global-metrics/quotes/latest` - Add global market metrics\r\n\r\n### 3. Enhanced Features\r\n\r\n- Price alerts configuration\r\n- Multi-currency price comparisons\r\n- Historical data analysis\r\n- Price change tracking\r\n- Market data aggregation\r\n- Advanced symbol resolution\r\n- Improved error messaging\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n0xspit",

Here are the key points:\r\n\r\n✅ The number of sections in the English and Romanian README files match, indicating the overall structure is similar. \r\n\r\n✅ Key phrases and core content appear to be translated accurately in the Romanian version.\r\n\r\n⚠️ However, the section titles and ordering don't match exactly between the two versions.\r\n\r\n## Section Differences\r\n\r\nThe Romanian README has sections that don't appear to have direct equivalents in the English version:\r\n\r\n- `## Rularea cu modele diferite` (Running with different models)\r\n- `## Cerințe suplimentare` (Additional requirements)\r\n- `## Telegram` \r\n- `## Bot Discord`\r\n- `## Teste` (Tests)\r\n\r\nThese sections seem to provide more details on configuring and running the bot with different models, setting up specific clients like Telegram and Discord, and running tests.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the English README has some sections missing in the Romanian version:\r\n\r\n- `## 🌍 README Translations`\r\n- `## Video Tutorials`\r\n- `## 🚀 Quick Start`\r\n- `## Contributors`\r\n- `## Star History`\r\n\r\nSo the Romanian version is missing information on alternate translations, video tutorials, a quick start guide, contributor info, and star history.\r\n\r\nSome section titles that do overlap have different names:\r\n- `## ✨ Features` (EN) vs `## Funcționalități` (RO)\r\n- `## 🎯 Use Cases` (EN) vs `## Pentru ce pot să-l folosesc?` (RO)\r\n\r\n## Recommendations\r\n\r\nTo fully align the English and Romanian READMEs, consider the following:\r\n\r\n1. Add the additional technical sections from the Romanian version to the English README where appropriate, to cover those extra details.\r\n\r\n2. Translate the meta project info sections from the English version and add them to the Romanian README.\r\n\r\n3. Rename the overlapping sections to match between the two versions for consistency.\r\n\r\n4. Review the ordering of sections and adjust as needed so they follow the same logical flow in both versions.\r\n\r\nOverall the translation looks good in terms of the core content, just needs some structural alignment. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further review!",

The main risks are:\r\n- Rate limiting from `CoinGecko API`\r\n- Potential timeout issues when the API is slow\r\n- Invalid cryptocurrency IDs causing failed requests\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- Adds a new CoinGecko plugin for cryptocurrency price checking\r\n- Implements a `GET_PRICE` action that fetches current prices\r\n- Provides TypeScript types and interfaces for CoinGecko API responses\r\n- Includes environment validation for API configuration\r\n- Adds proper error handling for API calls\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- New plugin implementation\r\n- New API integration\r\n- New TypeScript types\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n- Add CoinGecko plugin setup instructions\r\n- Document required/optional environment variables\r\n- Add usage examples for price checking\r\n- Update plugin list in main documentation\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the plugin implementation in `/plugin-coingecko/src/`\r\n2. Check the main action implementation in `getPrice.ts`\r\n3. Verify environment validation in `environment.ts`\r\n4. Review type definitions in `types.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Set up environment:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_api_key\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run agent locally and test natural language queries:\r\n   - \"What's the current price of Bitcoin?\"\r\n   - \"Show me ETH price in EUR\"\r\n   - \"How much is USDC worth?\"\r\n   - \"Get the price of Solana\"\r\n\r\n3. Verify error handling:\r\n   - Try with invalid coin names\r\n   - Test API timeout scenarios\r\n   - Check rate limit handling\r\n\r\n# Future Expansion\r\n1. Extended CoinGecko Integration:\r\n   - Support all coins listed on CoinGecko (currently ~10,000+ cryptocurrencies)\r\n   - Add coin metadata (market cap, volume, supply)\r\n   - Include historical price data and charts\r\n   - Support multiple currency conversions in a single query\r\n\r\n2. Additional API Features:\r\n   - `/simple/supported_vs_currencies` - Add support for all available fiat currencies\r\n   - `/coins/markets` - Include detailed market data\r\n   - `/coins/{id}/tickers` - Add exchange-specific price data\r\n   - `/coins/{id}/market_chart` - Support price charts and historical analysis\r\n   - `/global` - Add global crypto market metrics\r\n   - `/search` - Implement fuzzy search for coin names\r\n   - `/exchange_rates` - Support BTC-to-fiat conversion rates\r\n   - `/trending` - Add trending coins information\r\n\r\n3. Enhanced Features:\r\n   - Price alerts and notifications\r\n   - Price comparison across multiple coins\r\n   - Custom time range for historical data\r\n   - Price change percentage tracking\r\n   - Market sentiment analysis\r\n   - Portfolio tracking capabilities\r\n\r\n# Discord username\r\n0xspit",

    "body": "\r\n\r\n# Localhost Handling: Windows vs macOS\r\n\r\n## Windows Behavior\r\n1. Network Stack\r\n- Defaults to IPv6 (::1) when resolving `localhost`\r\n- More strict separation between localhost and IP address bindings\r\n- Requires explicit permissions for network interface bindings\r\n- More complex security model with Windows Firewall\r\n\r\n2. Access Control\r\n- Stricter access control policies\r\n- Requires explicit configuration to allow applications to bind to all interfaces\r\n- May require administrator privileges for certain network operations\r\n- Different handling for IPv4 and IPv6 connections\r\n\r\n3. Common Issues\r\n- EACCES errors when binding to ports\r\n- Permission problems with localhost access\r\n- IPv4/IPv6 conflicts in network applications\r\n- Needs explicit host configuration in development servers\r\n\r\n## macOS Behavior\r\n1. Network Stack\r\n- Unified handling of `localhost` resolution\r\n- Seamless integration between IPv4 and IPv6\r\n- More permissive default network interface bindings\r\n- Simplified security model\r\n\r\n2. Access Control\r\n- More lenient default permissions\r\n- Automatic handling of localhost-to-IP routing\r\n- Better integration between different network interfaces\r\n- Less restrictive port binding policies\r\n\r\n3. Advantages\r\n- \"It just works\" approach to localhost\r\n- Better default security without sacrificing developer experience\r\n- More consistent behavior across different network configurations\r\n- Less configuration needed for development environments\r\n\r\n## Development Impact\r\nThis is why development servers like Vite require different configurations:\r\n- Windows needs `host: true` to allow IP access\r\n- macOS works without special configuration\r\n- Windows often needs explicit IP addresses (127.0.0.1)\r\n- macOS handles localhost resolution more intelligently",

New `validateVectorSetup` function:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   private async validateVectorSetup(): Promise<boolean> {\r\n       try {\r\n           const vectorExt = await this.query(`\r\n               SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector'\r\n           `);\r\n           const hasVector = vectorExt.rows.length > 0;\r\n           \r\n           if (!hasVector) {\r\n               elizaLogger.error(\"Vector extension not found in database\");\r\n               return false;\r\n           }\r\n           \r\n           return true;\r\n       } catch (error) {\r\n           elizaLogger.error(\"Failed to validate vector extension:\", {\r\n               error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)\r\n           });\r\n           return false;\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Enhanced `init()` method:\r\n   - Added vector validation during initialization\r\n   - Improved schema application logic\r\n   - Better error handling for vector operations\r\n   - Proper dimension validation (1536)\r\n\r\n## Testing Infrastructure\r\n\r\n### New Test Suite\r\nLocated in `src/__tests__/`:\r\n\r\n1. `vector-extension.test.ts`:\r\n   - Schema management tests\r\n   - Memory operations with vector tests\r\n   - Error handling and validation tests\r\n\r\n2. `docker-compose.test.yml`:\r\n   ```yaml\r\n   version: '3.8'\r\n   services:\r\n     postgres-test:\r\n       image: pgvector/pgvector:pg16\r\n       environment:\r\n         POSTGRES_DB: eliza_test\r\n         POSTGRES_USER: postgres\r\n         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\r\n       ports:\r\n         - \"5433:5432\"\r\n       healthcheck:\r\n         test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"pg_isready\"]\r\n         interval: 10s\r\n         timeout: 5s\r\n         retries: 5\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. `run_tests.sh` - Automated test environment\r\n4. `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation\r\n\r\n## Test Results\r\n\r\n### Vector Extension Tests\r\n```\r\n✓ Schema and Extension Management (4/4)\r\n  ✓ should initialize with vector extension\r\n  ✓ should handle missing rooms table\r\n  ✓ should not reapply schema when everything exists\r\n  ✓ should handle transaction rollback on error\r\n\r\n✓ Memory Operations with Vector (3/3)\r\n  ✓ should create and retrieve memory with vector embedding\r\n  ✓ should search memories by embedding\r\n  ✓ should handle invalid embedding dimensions\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Environment Details\r\n- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector\r\n- Test database: eliza_test\r\n- Port: 5433 (isolated)\r\n- Vector dimensions: 1536 (OpenAI standard)\r\n\r\n## Key Improvements\r\n\r\n1. **Vector Validation**:\r\n   - Proper dimension verification (1536)\r\n   - Extension presence checks\r\n   - Clear error messages\r\n   - Robust validation logic\r\n\r\n2. **Testing Infrastructure**:\r\n   - Automated test environment\r\n   - Comprehensive test coverage\r\n   - Isolated testing setup\r\n   - Vector-specific test cases\r\n\r\n3. **Documentation**:\r\n   - Setup instructions\r\n   - Testing procedures\r\n   - Troubleshooting guide\r\n   - Vector operation examples\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- Resolves #1687\r\n- Ensures correct vector dimensions\r\n- Prevents invalid vector operations\r\n- Provides comprehensive testing\r\n- Improves error handling and logging\r\n- Better developer experience with clear error messages\r\n\r\n## Required Environment\r\n- PostgreSQL 16+\r\n- pgvector extension\r\n- Docker for testing\r\n- Node.js and pnpm\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n- Implementation validates vector dimensions properly\r\n- All tests passing successfully\r\n- Proper error handling for vector operations\r\n- Comprehensive test coverage for vector functionality\r\n- Clear error messages for debugging\r\n",

Changes are additive and follow existing patterns.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds support for a new embedding provider called \"Heurist\" with the following changes:\r\n1. Adds HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL configuration with BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 as default\r\n2. Integrates Heurist into the embedding provider system with 1024 dimension vectors\r\n3. Updates model configurations to use meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and FLUX.1-dev\r\n4. Implements remote embedding functionality for the Heurist provider\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - Adds new embedding provider capability\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to document the new Heurist embedding provider and its configuration options.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Check the .env.example file for the new HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL configuration\r\n2. Review the embedding.ts changes for proper integration\r\n3. Verify the model configuration updates in the Models section\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL in environment\r\n2. Test embedding generation with the new provider:\r\n   - Verify 1024-dimension vectors are generated correctly\r\n   - Confirm remote embedding functionality works\r\n   - Check fallback to BGE when appropriate\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nN/A - No UI changes involved\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nThe following environment variables need to be configured:\r\n- HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL=BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\r\n- USE_HEURIST_EMBEDDING=true\r\n- HEURIST_API_KEY (if using remote embeddings)\r\n\r\nand in the `character.json` use the following\r\n```\r\n    \"modelProvider\": \"heurist\",\r\n```",

    "title": "fix(postgres): Handle vector extension creation properly (#1561)",
    "body": "# PR: Fix PostgreSQL Vector Extension Issues (#1561)\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe PostgreSQL adapter was encountering a \"type vector does not exist\" error when trying to create tables that use the `vector` type. This was happening because:\r\n1. The `vector` extension was being created in the `extensions` schema\r\n2. The `vector` type wasn't accessible in the `public` schema where tables were being created\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nWe implemented a robust fix that:\r\n1. Creates the `extensions` schema if it doesn't exist\r\n2. Properly handles the `vector` extension creation in the `extensions` schema\r\n3. Adds the `extensions` schema to the search path before table creation\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n```sql\r\n-- Create extensions schema first\r\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS extensions;\r\n\r\nDO $$\r\nBEGIN\r\n    IF NOT EXISTS (\r\n        SELECT 1\r\n        FROM pg_extension\r\n        WHERE extname = 'vector'\r\n    ) THEN\r\n        CREATE EXTENSION vector\r\n        SCHEMA extensions;\r\n    END IF;\r\nEND $$;\r\n\r\n-- Add extensions schema to search path\r\nSET search_path TO public, extensions;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing and Verification\r\n### Test Environment\r\n- Docker container using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image\r\n- Clean PostgreSQL instance with pgvector support\r\n- Database: `eliza_test`\r\n\r\n### Test Scenarios\r\n\r\n1. **Initial Installation Test**\r\n   - ✅ Schema creation successful\r\n   - ✅ Vector extension created without errors\r\n   - ✅ All tables created with correct vector type\r\n   - ✅ All indexes created successfully\r\n   - ✅ Transaction committed successfully\r\n\r\n2. **Idempotency Test (Second Run)**\r\n   - ✅ No duplicate key errors\r\n   - ✅ Proper handling of existing objects with NOTICE messages\r\n   - ✅ Vector extension checks working correctly\r\n   - ✅ Transaction committed successfully\r\n\r\n### Test Results\r\n```sql\r\n-- First Run Output\r\nCREATE SCHEMA\r\nDO\r\nCREATE EXTENSION\r\nSET\r\n[... tables and indexes created successfully ...]\r\nCOMMIT\r\n\r\n-- Second Run Output\r\nNOTICE: schema \"extensions\" already exists, skipping\r\nCREATE SCHEMA\r\nDO\r\n[... proper \"already exists\" notices ...]\r\nCOMMIT\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nThis fix:\r\n- Resolves issue #1561\r\n- Prevents duplicate extension creation errors\r\n- Maintains proper schema organization\r\n- Ensures vector operations work correctly across schemas\r\n- Provides idempotent schema creation\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n- The solution follows PostgreSQL best practices for extension management\r\n- Schema search path is explicitly set to ensure type availability\r\n- Implementation is idempotent and safe to run multiple times\r\n- Tested with pgvector-enabled PostgreSQL instance\r\n- No changes required to application code\r\n\r\n## Required Environment\r\n- PostgreSQL 15 or later\r\n- pgvector extension must be available (e.g., using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image)\r\n- Proper permissions to create schemas and extensions\r\n",

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - This is a UI refactor that changes the navigation structure but doesn't affect core functionality.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR refactors the client application to follow a more traditional chat application layout. The current multi-page approach requires extra navigation steps to switch between agents. This redesign aims to simplify the experience by making it easier to switch between conversations while maintaining context.\r\n\r\n- Removes the multi-page routing structure in favor of a single-page chat interface\r\n- Implements a collapsible sidebar containing agent selection\r\n- Adds a chat-like interface with agent header and message thread\r\n- Integrates theme toggle into the new sidebar\r\n- Adds avatar generation for agents using DiceBear\r\n- Improves overall UI/UX with modern chat application patterns\r\n\r\n## Questions to Consider\r\n1. Is chat the primary interaction mode we want to focus on?\r\n2. Is there a specific planned feature roadmap for `client` app?\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Start with `client/src/Agents.tsx` to review the new main layout structure\r\n2. Review `client/src/Chat.tsx` to see the simplified chat component\r\n3. Check the router changes in `client/src/router.tsx`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Launch the application and verify the new sidebar layout appears\r\n2. Test sidebar collapse/expand functionality\r\n3. Select different agents and verify chat history remains isolated\r\n4. Test theme toggle in the new sidebar location\r\n5. Verify message sending/receiving still works as expected\r\n6. Test responsive design at various screen sizes\r\n7. Verify avatar generation for each agent\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![eliza_chat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0035a547-8721-4fee-8b50-b16283c31a0b)\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nStandard deployment - no special steps required.\r\n",
