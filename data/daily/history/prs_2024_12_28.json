I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.  I know there is alot of interest in the memory system as well so as part of the core it should be as clear as possible IMHO."

    "body": "# Relates to:\r\nNo\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n**Low**\r\n- Adjustments to database queries improve performance by moving sorting and limiting logic to the database side.\r\n- Even though this change adds improvements to the Postgres adapter and required a change in the global `IDatabaseAdapter`, other database adapters are still working because the `limit` parameter is optional.\r\n- Other plugins relying on the `getMemoriesByRoomIds` function can opt into the `limit` functionality, but it is not necessary.\r\n- No breaking changes introduced.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR improves the performance of memory-fetching functionality by:\r\n- Moving sorting and slicing logic from the application layer to the database layer.\r\n- Adding an optional `limit` parameter to restrict the number of results fetched from the database.\r\n- Adjusting the runtime logic to leverage the new database query functionality.\r\n\r\n## Why was this change made?\r\nIn our database with **60,000 memories**, fetching memories by room IDs took **40 seconds**, significantly affecting the performance of the agent. After applying this fix, the query execution time dropped to just **0.02 seconds**. This improvement was observed using Supabase analytics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Changes to existing functionality to improve database query performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts` to understand how sorting and limiting were implemented in the database query.\r\n- Look at the adjusted runtime logic in `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` for the integration of the `limit` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Ensure all existing tests for memory fetching pass.\r\n2. Manually test the memory-fetching feature by:\r\n   - Querying with and without the `limit` parameter.\r\n   - Verifying that the sorting order (`createdAt DESC`) is maintained.\r\n3. Monitor query performance with larger datasets to confirm improvements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n- Updated query logic to include `ORDER BY createdAt DESC` and optional `LIMIT` in the PostgreSQL adapter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nI will attach screenshots of:\r\n- Successful working run with Postgres and SQLite.\r\n- Successful linting results.\r\n\r\n### Using Postgres adapter\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1054\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 13 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3606a21a-6933-402b-ae7d-d24ecb6a1263\" />\r\n<img width=\"1126\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 15 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b8a289-1cae-4a2f-9493-25cf79dc2d4b\" />\r\n\r\n### Using SQLite adapter\r\n<img width=\"1087\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 16 57 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a7f49f4-9880-4d4a-9586-d9548fda7dd5\" />\r\n<img width=\"543\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 18 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e04f844-ab14-44e3-a7f4-2601a853af46\" />\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 28 45 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82b35cad-c73a-46d0-b52c-5b1e05d87388\" />\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 29 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857b593f-f9e4-4774-a44a-358ea26155d8\" />\r\n",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8. Please let me know if anything is broke when you test it, it worked well on my end.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Shaiw Talks like Shaw\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/241b9420-8a6c-4115-ba73-7438bba91156)\r\n\r\n### Casual Conversation\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2b4a44-da93-4c80-902d-284222855811)\r\n\r\n### More\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adbf96ba-6f0b-4f58-8714-2fbc048b962e)\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nCaution: the docs site is crawled and inserted into vectordb on launch, each time you load the agent, this will happen. During testing, I suggest using cleanstart startup script, to wipe the database.  In production, this will need to be managed through db, if new pages are loaded.  This may need fixed in future to make this easier to manage.\r\n\r\n<!--  Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n## Database changes\r\nNeed to change from sqlite, to the database you use in test/production.\r\n\r\n<!--  If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n## Discord username\r\naah8098 (Allen)\r\n",

The image description is too long because it uses the full prompt as the caption. This exceeds the character limit for Telegram image captions, sometimes resulting in an caption too long error.
