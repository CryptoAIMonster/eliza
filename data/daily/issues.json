Please describe.**\r\nI would like to have more information concerning how to run Eliza locally with multiple graphical cards. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI don't really know where to start with solving this issue, for example, I am not sure if the problem comes from my installation, or a necessary modification of the Eliza code.  \r\nThe ideal solution would be to have notes in the documentation on the subject. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI asked on the Discord if anybody was aware of a solution, but unfortunately, nobody could help. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI run the system on a Debian. The two graphical cards are NVIDIA ones, but of different generations. \r\nEliza works properly using a single card with CUDA, cuBLAS, cuDNN and node-llama-cpp installed, but I am not certain of the necessary installation to run the second card. \r\nnividia-detect and nvidia-smi show both my cards. \r\n\r\nAlso, I was not certain that it was the right place to post, but as it is not related to a bug or a security issue, I figured that \"Features request\" would be my best bet. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n",
