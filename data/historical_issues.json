Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, the logging mechanism in `/packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins` lacks detailed output, making it difficult to trace issues and monitor performance effectively.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nIntegrate the `elizaLogger` construct to provide more comprehensive logging throughout the codebase. This would involve:\n- Adding entry and exit logs for key functions.\n- Including detailed error logging with stack traces.\n- Logging significant state changes and data processing steps.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nConsidered using a third-party logging library, but `elizaLogger` offers a more integrated solution with existing infrastructure.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nUtilize existing examples of `elizaLogger` usage in other parts of the codebase as a reference. Extend these examples to cover more complex scenarios within the `/packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins` path.",

    "title": "Support for building monorepo with git dependencies using pnpm and nix",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen trying to build a pnpm monorepo using Nix's buildNpmPackage that includes git dependencies (specifically @discordjs/opus), the build fails due to git access restrictions in the Nix build environment. The current workarounds involve either modifying package.json or pre-fetching git dependencies, both of which are not ideal solutions for maintaining the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA built-in way to handle git dependencies in buildNpmPackage that:\r\n\r\n 1. Automatically fetches git dependencies using fetchgit during the build process\r\n 2. Maintains compatibility with pnpm workspaces and monorepo structure\r\n 3. Preserves the original package.json without requiring modifications\r\n 4. Works with trusted dependencies in pnpm\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Manually pre-fetching git dependencies and placing them in node_modules\r\n2. Modifying package.json to use published versions instead of git dependencies\r\n3. Using mkDerivation instead of buildNpmPackage to handle the build process manually\r\n4. Creating a custom derivation to handle git dependencies before the main build\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue particularly affects projects using Discord.js and similar packages that rely on git dependencies for native modules. The current workarounds either break the development workflow or require maintaining separate package configurations for Nix builds.\r\nExample of a failing build: \r\n\r\n`ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH Cannot proceed with the frozen installation. The current \"overrides\" configuration doesn't match the value found in the lockfile`\r\n",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe `pnpm install` command is incorrectly updating the lock file during installations, leading to potential inconsistencies in dependency versions across different environments. This behavior can cause unexpected issues when deploying or running the application, as the installed packages may not match the versions specified in the lock file.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository.\r\n2. Run the command `pnpm install` without the `--frozen-lockfile` option.\r\n3. Observe that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is updated with new versions of dependencies, even if they are not specified in the `package.json`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe `pnpm install` command should respect the `--frozen-lockfile` option, preventing any updates to the lock file. This ensures that the installed dependencies match the versions specified in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, maintaining consistency across different environments.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue was addressed in a recent commit that added the `--frozen-lockfile` option to various installation commands in the project, including in the GitHub workflows, Dockerfile, and scripts. The explicit update script was also introduced to allow updates without the frozen lock file option, ensuring that developers can manage dependencies more effectively without risking unintended changes to the lock file.",

Manual Documentation Phase:\r\n   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript files\r\n   - Include documentation for functions, classes, interfaces, and other code blocks\r\n\r\n2. Automation Implementation:\r\n   - Develop an LLM-based automation solution for generating JSDoc comments\r\n   - Integrate the automation into our CI/CD pipeline (like when a PR for a new feat is merged)\r\n   - Create a manual trigger mechanism for the automation process\r\n\r\n**Create a GitHub Actions workflow/AI agent that:**\r\n\r\n1. Automated Documentation Generation:\r\n   - Triggers on demand (via workflow_dispatch) or when specific files change\r\n   - Scans TypeScript files that lack JSDoc documentation\r\n   - Uses an AI service (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate contextually accurate JSDoc comments\r\n   - Maintains existing JSDoc comments and only adds missing ones\r\n\r\n2. Quality Control:\r\n   - Follows our existing JSDoc standards and TypeDoc configuration\r\n   - Validates generated comments for completeness and accuracy\r\n   - Ensures proper documentation of parameters, return types, and function descriptions\r\n\r\n3. Pull Request Management:\r\n   - Creates a new branch for documentation updates\r\n   - Generates a pull request with the changes\r\n   - Adds appropriate labels (e.g., 'documentation', 'automated')\r\n   - Includes a detailed PR description explaining the changes\r\n   - Assigns relevant reviewers\r\n\r\n4. Configuration:\r\n   - Allows customization of AI prompt templates\r\n   - Provides options to include/exclude specific files or directories\r\n   - Configurable commit message and PR templates\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Manual documentation enforcement through PR checks\r\n2. Using existing JSDoc generation tools like https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc\r\n3. Implementing stricter code review policies for documentation\r\n4. Creating documentation sprints for batch updates\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRequired Permissions and Secrets:\r\n- GitHub token with PR creation permissions\r\n- AI service API key (e.g., OpenAI)\r\n- Repository write access for branch creation\r\n\r\n### Additional Motivation\r\n\r\nThis could be a proof of concept AI junior dev Karpathy talks about\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c3c68f-d85a-414c-a26f-231bd6ecb831)\r\n\r\n",

Use proper sequential numbering (1, 2)\r\n2. Replace \"eg.\" with \"Example:\" to match documentation style\r\n3. Use a more clear example number (9999)\r\n\r\nThe final format should look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.\r\n    \r\n    1. The name of the branch should start with the issue number and be descriptive of the changes you are making.  \r\n    2. Example: 9999--add-test-for-bug-123]\r\n ```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Keeping \"eg.\" but it's less formal than our documentation style\r\n2. Using different formatting like \"For example:\" or \"(example:)\" but \"Example:\" is cleaner\r\n4. Using a bullet point for the example, but numbered lists better show the relationship between the instruction and its example\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis change aligns with our documentation styleguide and makes the contribution guidelines more consistent and professional. It's a small change that improves readability and maintains our documentation standards.\r\n",

In the `docs/community/` section there's a bunch of summaries based on various discord channels. Me and @odilitime are working on automating this process. Overall though, love the bot idea.

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe project currently lacks Hebrew (RTL) language support in its documentation. While there are translations for several other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, etc.), Hebrew-speaking users cannot read the documentation in their native language. This is particularly important because Hebrew requires special RTL (Right-to-Left) formatting considerations.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Hebrew (RTL) translation of the main README.md as README_HE.md, including:  \r\n\r\n - Full translation of all sections including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines  \r\n - Proper RTL formatting using HTML/CSS directives\r\n - Addition of Hebrew (עִברִית) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\nMaintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) - inadequate because it doesn't handle RTL formatting properly and translations are often inaccurate\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nHebrew is spoken by approximately 9 million people globally\r\n\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format)\r\n\r\nSpecial attention should be paid to RTL formatting using <div align=\"rtl\"> tags to ensure proper text direction\r\n\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Hebrew-speaking developer community",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nAdded Twitter cookies per the docs and every time I run things, it triggers a new login alert from Twitter so something seems off. Considered trying the cookies from a logged in browser, but it uses the x.com domain, and when you try to add those, startup complains about the wrong domain. Login works, posting works, it just seems that the cookies should work to not trigger new logins each time. Guessing at some point Twitter will flag continuous logins like this. If I don't add cookies at all, same thing, it works, but triggers a login alert email each time.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSimply starting Eliza with Twitter credentials added + manual cookies. They do get cached in the db, but on restart, it still doesn't consider itself logged in and I get an email.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nStay logged in. Don't trigger a new login email alert from Twitter.\r\n",

    "title": "feat: Support Fetching Character Files From Storage Service",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nFor our use case at Phala Network, we are building a base template docker image for developers to deploy their agents to our TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) Cloud. However, we want to make the loading of the character json file easier to add via a command line argument vs building a new docker image with the new character file. Our main pain point is we want the user journey for technical to non-technical users to be able to publish their character configuration file to a storage protocol like arweave, ipfs, aws, etc. and be able to load those character files in through a command argument. This will make our deploy service easier with a docker compose file that can list the file id location in an argument like `pnpm start --characterUrl=https://characterfile.url`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe developer journey would go as follows:\r\n- Generate a character JSON file through any means (keep this step unopinionated)\r\n- Publish the character file to a storage service. (Ex. Use Thirdweb to post and pin to IPFS https://972b74063c2cd00df1a4cf777bf37d0a.ipfscdn.io/ipfs/bafybeicod5xghpshbxmfb3sh2ccfbb5657dgvxthgwolb42srz4a5iadwm/)\r\n- Create a new CLI argument to the `pnpm start` command named `--characterUrl` that will take in the URL where the character file is hosted\r\n- When the agent is being initialized, `fetch` the character file from the URL and allow for the agent to go through the natural process of starting up the agent\r\n\r\nCode changes should be minimal and would not affect any core functionality so the risk is low.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatives were building a web app similar to vvaifu, but this would not be a good user experience for cloud deployments or a good strategy to compete with them since we are focused on different problems.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis will help bring more users to Eliza with better security and privacy guarantees by utilizing TEE for safe Eliza agent cloud deployments.\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nExample deployment with a mock docker compose file in the TEE Cloud.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0bec2d0-aa0e-418c-bf88-67e37edf1a17)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nBuild failure in `@ai16z/eliza package` due to unresolved dependency `@ai16z/plugin-image-generation`. The build process fails when attempting to resolve the image generation plugin import in `defaultCharacter.ts`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- 1. Clone the eliza repository (v0.1.5-alpha.5)\r\n- 2. Import and add the `imageGenerationPlugin` to Eliza in `defaultCharacter.ts`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\nimport { imageGenerationPlugin } from \"@ai16z/plugin-image-generation\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [imageGenerationPlugin],\r\n```\r\n- 3. Run `pnpm build` in the project root\r\n- 4. Build fails with error message indicating it cannot resolve \"@ai16z/plugin-image-generation\" in defaultCharacter.ts\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe build process should successfully compile all packages including @ai16z/eliza. The @ai16z/plugin-image-generation package should be properly resolved as it's listed in the workspace packages.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- Project version: v0.1.5-alpha.\r\n- Build tool: turbo 2.3.3\r\n- Package manager: pnpm\r\n- The package @ai16z/plugin-image-generation is listed in the workspace scope but fails to resolve during build\r\n- Error occurs in the ESM build step using tsup\r\n- File causing error: packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts\r\n\r\n\r\n**Exact error:**\r\n```sh\r\nUSER@MACHINE MINGW64

    "body": "Hey Guys! \r\n\r\nWe are attempting to enable the Eliza AI bot to post tweets using the agent-twitter-client setup as described in the Eliza documentation. We have the bot running smoothly via Telegram and the character are starting to behave exactly as wanted. Next step is Twitter/X posts. \r\n\r\nDespite following the documented process and adapting various approaches, we encountered multiple challenges, including issues with cookies-based authentication and OAuth2 flow.\r\n\r\nSteps Taken:\r\n\r\nCookies Authentication:\r\n\r\nExtracted cookies (auth_token, ct0, guest_id) directly from a valid, logged-in Twitter session.\r\nParsed cookies into the required format and supplied them to the scraper.\r\nEncountered Session is invalid. Login required. after setting the cookies.\r\nRetried using different extracted cookies after logging out and back into the account but received suspicious login alerts from Twitter.\r\n\r\nOAuth2 Authentication (User Context):\r\nConfigured the TWITTER_CLIENT_ID, TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET, and TWITTER_REDIRECT_URL in .env file.\r\n\r\nGenerated the authorization URL and successfully obtained an authorization code after approving the app.\r\n\r\nExchanged the authorization code for an access token. This step initially failed due to redirect URI mismatch but was resolved after fixing .env and redirect configurations.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully retrieved an access token but encountered a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to post a tweet using the provided access token.\r\n\r\nOther Efforts:\r\nTested multiple approaches to ensure the server was running properly (ngrok tunnel, express server for callback handling).\r\n\r\nUsed the provided Eliza example retry mechanisms, cookies validation steps, and OAuth2 flows, but no approach successfully enabled the bot to interact with Twitter.\r\n\r\nTechnical Environment:\r\n\r\nEliza Package Version: 0.1.4-alpha.3\r\nNode.js Version: v23.0.0\r\nTwitter API Version: v2\r\nPlan: Free tier with 100 monthly interactions allowed.\r\nErrors Encountered:\r\n\r\nCookies Authentication Error: Session is invalid. Login required.\r\nOAuth2 Access Token Exchange Error: \"Value passed for the redirect uri did not match the uri of the authorization code.\"\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Error:\r\n{\r\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\r\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\",\r\n  \"status\": 403,\r\n  \"detail\": \"Forbidden\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat We’ve Tried:\r\n\r\nFollowed the Eliza documentation for both cookies-based login and OAuth2 authentication.\r\nValidated cookies format, paths, and domains. Adjusted callback URLs to match the redirect URI.\r\nEnsured correct scopes (tweet.read, tweet.write, offline.access) were included in the authorization URL. Searched for solutions in related GitHub issues and documentation but could not resolve these issues.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\nCookies-based login: Is there an additional step needed to validate or reuse cookies without triggering suspicious login alerts?\r\n\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Forbidden: Are there any known limitations or configurations for the free tier that could block posting tweets, even after successfully obtaining an access token?\r\n\r\nDocumentation Alignment: Are there updated instructions or examples specific to the latest Twitter API v2 and free-tier limitations that might clarify the proper setup?\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to enable the Eliza bot to post tweets under the speedcto account using either method (cookies or OAuth2).\r\n\r\nThe free-tier plan should suffice for our initial testing (17 tweets/day, 100 interactions/month).\r\nAny guidance or updates on how to resolve these issues would be highly appreciated!",

Based on the amount of chats made with my AI Agent the agents wallet or I as the creator will earn token rewards sent by Avatar.One.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nI am the founder of Avatar.One a 3D AI Chatbot app combining animated VRM avatars with NSFW chat. In our app we have our own avatar maker which allows for over 100k combinations - we can also import custom VRMs. Our app is built on Three.js and loads on mobile and desktop. The companions on Avatar.One come with unique emotes, roleplay features including Netflix and chill, Cyberpunk, Anime Adventure and more. The characters can make selfies, have extensive memory, have custom emotes including striptease and twerk, 1000's of different clothing, the ability for them to go fully naked and of course NSFW chat is enabled.\r\n\r\nWe would like to contribute a plugin to AI16Z which allows Eliza Agents to have their own Avatar.One character profile. They will have their own \"OnlyFans\" profile page which will include bio, profile image, links etc. \r\n\r\nWe will reward the AI Agents or the creators wallet with tokens based on the amount of chats made with the AI Agent. This will drive an income for the AI Agents. It will of course please some of their fans to have NSFW chat. \r\n\r\nAll of our chats are SSH encrypted and stored only on private databases. All users have the ability to delete their history immediately.\r\n\r\nThe full character profile can be added to Avatar.One and their chat will replicate their characters shared on other channel such as Discord.\r\n\r\nAs many AI Agents do not have their own VRMs we can use a vanilla avatar from our maker with the AI Agents profile image applied on the clothing or background of the virtual room. Open to suggestions here.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e18749-6213-48a3-8e36-c535cbe79f40)",

Does converting to this standard protocol enhance that at all? I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nBased on the extensive MCP documentation provided, here are some hypothetical benefits of integrating MCP into this codebase:\r\n\r\n1. **Standardized AI-System Communication**\r\n    - The codebase could leverage MCP's standardized protocol for communication between the AI (Claude) and various system resources\r\n    - This would provide a more structured and secure way to handle interactions compared to custom implementations\r\n\r\n2. **Resource Management**\r\n    - MCP's resource system could help manage character files and data in a standardized way\r\n    - Characters could be exposed as MCP resources with proper MIME types and metadata\r\n    - Real-time updates to character data could leverage MCP's resource subscription system\r\n\r\n3. **Tool Integration**\r\n    - MCP tools could provide standardized ways to:\r\n      - Read/write character files\r\n      - Validate character data\r\n      - Perform character-related operations\r\n      - Handle file system operations securely\r\n    - Tools could be exposed with clear schemas and descriptions for the AI to understand\r\n\r\n4. **Security Benefits**\r\n    - MCP's security model would provide better isolation and control over what the AI can access\r\n    - Built-in validation and sanitization of inputs\r\n    - Controlled access to file system and other resources\r\n    - Clear error handling patterns\r\n\r\n5. **Development Benefits**\r\n    - Better debugging capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Standardized logging and error reporting\r\n    - Clear separation between AI capabilities and system operations\r\n    - Type safety through SDK integrations\r\n    - Built-in progress reporting for long operations\r\n\r\n6. **Extensibility**\r\n    - Easy addition of new capabilities through MCP servers\r\n    - Potential to integrate with other tools and services\r\n    - Standardized way to add new features that interact with the AI\r\n\r\n7. **Testing & Maintenance**\r\n    - Better testing capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Clear protocol specifications make maintenance easier\r\n    - Standard patterns for error handling and logging\r\n    - Built-in tools for debugging and monitoring\r\n\r\nThis would represent a shift from custom implementations to a standardized protocol, potentially making the codebase more maintainable and extensible while improving security and reliability.\r\n"

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now actions are mostly seen as \"side effect\"  happening next to an answer sent by the agent.\r\nThere is no automated way to get the agent to call an action, interpret the result, and answer with that interpretation (which is what I would expect coming from OpenAI actions that are APIs that their runtime call and then get the result interpreted by the agent)\r\n\r\nRight now if I ask my agent: `what actions can you perform right now in the game?`\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"◎ Agent: I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\"] \r\n [\"◎ Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThere are two things that could be done. \r\nThe simple one would just have the action result override the answer from the agent (so in the previous example, the first text `I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?` wouldn't even be sent to the client).\r\n\r\nThe complicated one, would have do a second back-and forth with the agent, after getting the action result, in order to interpret that result.\r\n\r\nA) simple:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\", type: \"OVERRIDE_ANSWER\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"◎ Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n> here, simply adding a \"type\" (or any other field name) with value `OVERRIDE_ANSWER` to the action result, would tell the system to not send the agent answer, only the action result, to the client\r\n\r\nB) complicated:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore!

        "body": "you could solve this at a more fundamental level by splitting agents into worker vs character types \r\n\r\nworker agents would be all business - they'd just execute actions and return results directly, perfect for stuff like `LIST_GAME_ACTIONS`. no personality, no fluff, just data.\r\n\r\ncharacter agents would be the chatty ones that interpret results and add narrative flair.\r\n\r\nyou could even take a temperature-based approach to balance between these - low temps giving you more worker-like behavior with just the facts, while higher temps let the agent be more expressive and narrative in their responses.\r\n\r\nthis split would naturally handle both your scenarios:\r\n- simple case: worker agents automatically override their response with action results  \r\n- complex case: character agents process action results and craft narrative responses\r\n\r\nbut if you want to move forward with your override/interpretation types approach first, that's totally workable too. you could handle it at the runtime level to avoid client mods.\r\n\r\nthe worker/character abstraction is there when you're ready to tackle the bigger architectural picture - it would make all of this stuff cleaner and more consistent in the long run"

    "title": "Disable Safety Checker for FAL Image Generation",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMany image generation services such as FAL, Stable Diffusion, etc. have \"safety checkers\" that ensure prompts are appropriate.\r\nThese have several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Additional latency: These checks are done via an LLM, which can add unnecessary latency.\r\n2. Unpredictable / incorrect outputs: Since the checks use LLMs, their output can be overly restrictive or random, causing unpredictable behavior.\r\n3. Not necessary: Some use cases don't require the safety checker.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we at [daojones.ai](daojones.ai) ([@DAOJonesPumpAI](x.com/DAOJonesPumpAI) on X.com) have found this is overly restrictive and have written a custom image generation application that disables it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe want to set the FAL configuration for our image requests.\r\nWe need to set `enable_safety_checker` to `false` while also setting `safety_tolerance` to `6` (the most tolerant setting).\r\nSince these options are not uniformly supported by the different APIs, we will just add an \"escape hatch\" configuration `imageSettings.fal`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Turning safety checker off globally: This would work for our use case but could be a breaking change for other use cases.\r\n2. Adding a global `allowNsfw` flag: This requires reconciling this with other APIs and determining what settings it would correspond to.\r\n3. Adding the `enableSafetyChecker` / `safetyTolerance` flags at the top level of `imageSettings`: this would pollute the global namespace.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n",

Here's the sequence:\r\n\r\n1. First call:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst responseMessages = await callback(responseContent);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Then the callback is passed to `processActions`:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait this.runtime.processActions(\r\n    memory,\r\n    responseMessages,\r\n    state,\r\n    callback  // <-- Same callback passed here\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Inside `processActions`, the action handler might call the callback again:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait action.handler(this, message, state, {}, callback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you could:\r\n\r\n1. Either modify the callback to be single-use:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts\r\nconst createCallback = () => {\r\n    let used = false;\r\n    return async (content: Content, files: any[]) => {\r\n        if (used) {\r\n            elizaLogger.warn(\"Callback already used, skipping\");\r\n            return [];\r\n        }\r\n        used = true;\r\n        // ... rest of callback logic ...\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst callback = createCallback();\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Or create separate callbacks for the initial response and actions:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts\r\nconst responseMessages = await callback(responseContent);\r\n\r\n// Create a new callback for actions that doesn't create memories\r\nconst actionCallback: HandlerCallback = async (content: Content, files: any[]) => {\r\n    try {\r\n        if (!content?.text.trim()) {\r\n            elizaLogger.warn(\"Skipping empty content\");\r\n            return [];\r\n        }\r\n        return await sendMessageInChunks(\r\n            message.channel as TextChannel,\r\n            content.text,\r\n            message.id,\r\n            files\r\n        );\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n        console.error(\"Error in action callback:\", error);\r\n        return [];\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nawait this.runtime.processActions(\r\n    memory,\r\n    responseMessages,\r\n    state,\r\n    actionCallback\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second approach might be better as it makes the distinction between response handling and action handling clearer.\r\n"

    "title": "Epic: Refactoring Eliza's Trading System for Multi-Chain Compatibility",
    "body": "**Overview:**\r\n\r\nThis epic addresses the need to refactor Eliza's trading system to improve multi-chain compatibility and resolve the current conflict between the Solana plugin (and other individual chain plugins) and Coinbase SDK. The goal is to create a more flexible and extensible architecture that can accommodate various blockchain integrations and trading strategies.\r\n\r\n**Goals:**\r\n\r\n* Eliminate redundancy and inconsistency between the plugins for individual chains and Coinbase SDK.\r\n* Establish a unified trading interface that can be implemented by different blockchain/exchange adapters.\r\n* Implement a centralized data source or normalization layer for price and market data.\r\n* Develop a unified wallet management system for different blockchain/exchange wallets.\r\n* Support diverse trading strategies beyond simple token swaps (e.g., swing trading, day trading).\r\n* Ensure scalability and maintainability of the trading system as new integrations are added.\r\n\r\n**Decision Points:**\r\n\r\n* **DP1: Coinbase SDK Focus vs. Multi-SDK Support:**\r\n    * **Option A: Prioritize Coinbase SDK:** Focus primarily on the Coinbase SDK and contribute back to its development to enhance its functionality and multi-chain support.  This would involve working closely with the Coinbase team and aligning development efforts.\r\n    * **Option B: Create a Training Module/Adapter System:** Develop a training module or adapter system that allows Eliza to seamlessly integrate with different SDKs (Coinbase, Solana Web3.js, etc.). This would provide greater flexibility but require more upfront development effort.  This approach requires designing abstract interfaces for trading, data retrieval, and wallet management.\r\n    * **Option C: Hybrid Approach:**  Start with a focus on the Coinbase SDK for its existing multi-chain support, but design the system with the future flexibility to add other SDKs via an adapter pattern.  This would balance immediate needs with long-term extensibility.\r\n\r\n* **DP2: Centralized vs. Decentralized Data Management:**\r\n    * **Option A: Centralized Data Source:** Choose a single, reliable data provider for price and market data.  This simplifies data management but creates a single point of failure.\r\n    * **Option B: Decentralized Data Aggregation:**  Aggregate data from multiple sources (Coinbase, Jupiter, Birdeye, etc.) and implement a normalization layer to handle discrepancies and ensure data consistency. This approach is more robust but increases complexity.\r\n\r\n* **DP3: Unified Wallet Management Strategy:**\r\n    * **Option A: Abstract Wallet Interface:**  Develop an abstract wallet interface that can be implemented by different wallet providers (Solana, Coinbase, etc.).  This allows for flexibility in wallet selection but requires careful design.\r\n    * **Option B:  Custom Wallet Management Service:** Create a custom wallet management service within Eliza that interacts directly with different wallet APIs.  This provides more control but increases development effort.\r\n\r\n* **DP4: Scope of Trading Strategies:**\r\n    * **Option A:  Focus on Long-Term Holding:** Initially, limit support to long-term buy-and-hold strategies, simplifying the trust engine and trade management.\r\n    * **Option B:  Support Arbitrary Trading:** Implement support for a wider range of trading strategies (swing trading, day trading, etc.) from the outset.  This increases complexity but provides greater flexibility.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Sub-Tickets (Initial List - To be refined):**\r\n\r\n* **ST1: Design Abstract Trading Interface:** Design a unified trading interface that can be implemented by different blockchain/exchange adapters.\r\n* **ST2: Implement Coinbase Adapter:** Create a Coinbase adapter that implements the abstract trading interface, handling trade execution, data retrieval, and wallet management.\r\n* **ST3: Implement Solana Adapter:** Create a Solana adapter that implements the abstract trading interface.\r\n* **ST4: Develop Data Normalization Layer (if needed):** If using multiple data sources, create a data normalization layer to ensure data consistency.\r\n* **ST5: Implement Unified Wallet Management System:**  Develop a unified wallet management system that supports multiple blockchain/exchange wallets.\r\n* **ST6: Implement Position Tracking:**  Create a system for tracking open positions and trade history.\r\n* **ST7: Enhance Trust Engine for Arbitrary Trading:** Modify the trust engine to support different trade types, timeframes, and performance metrics.\r\n* **ST8: Develop Backtesting Framework:** Implement a backtesting framework for evaluating trading strategies.\r\n* **ST9: Implement Automated Trading Engine:** Develop an automated trading engine.\r\n* **ST10: Testing and Validation:**  Develop a comprehensive test suite for the refactored trading system, covering different adapters, data sources, and trading scenarios.\r\n* **ST11: Documentation and Examples:**  Update the documentation to reflect the changes in the trading system architecture and provide examples of using different adapters and strategies.\r\n\r\n**Next Steps:**\r\n\r\n* Conduct thorough research and analysis to inform decisions on each decision point.\r\n* Prioritize sub-tickets based on chosen architecture and strategic goals.\r\n* Assign sub-tickets to developers and create a development roadmap.\r\n* Regularly review progress and update this epic ticket accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis epic provides a roadmap for refactoring Eliza's trading system to achieve multi-chain compatibility and support more advanced trading strategies. Careful consideration of the decision points and collaborative development of the sub-tickets will result in a more robust, scalable, and versatile trading platform for Eliza agents.",

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe EVM Plugin actions do not work, they probably never worked.\r\n\r\nThe [code assumes](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/main/packages/plugin-evm/src/actions/transfer.ts#L56-L65) that the options object passed to the handler of the action has all the parameters of the action parsed automagically. It's assuming a tool calling pattern like the one AI SDK offers.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Add an `EVM_PUBLIC_KEY` and an `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` to run the evmPlugin\r\n2. Hardcode the balance returned by the [wallet provider](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/main/packages/plugin-evm/src/providers/wallet.ts#L187) to 5 ETH.\r\n3. Build the `plugin-evm` with `pnpm build`\r\n3. Run the agent and use the example prompt from the plugin: `Transfer 1 ETH to 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e`\r\n4. The agent should fail with error ` [\"⛔ TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'chainId')\"] ` \r\n\r\nYou can also add a `console.log` when transfer is called with the params and you will see the content is empty.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAgent should fail because transaction failed.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"727\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 02 18 52\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e107a4cb-144b-406d-9e8c-d4e8f8a5def7\">",

This enhancement adds comprehensive voice configuration support in character cards for both VITS and ElevenLabs, with proper fallbacks.\r\n\r\n**Changes Made**\r\n- Voice settings from character configuration are now properly used for both VITS and ElevenLabs\r\n- Automatic fallback to VITS when ElevenLabs API key is not present\r\n- Made ElevenLabs configuration fields optional in schema\r\n- Added better logging for voice selection process\r\n- Added support for full ElevenLabs configuration in character cards\r\n\r\n**Example Character Configuration**\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"voice\": {\r\n            \"model\": \"en_GB-alan-medium\",  // For VITS\r\n            \"elevenlabs\": {   // Optional ElevenLabs configuration\r\n                \"voiceId\": \"your-voice-id\",\r\n                \"model\": \"eleven_monolingual_v1\",\r\n                \"stability\": \"0.5\",\r\n                \"similarityBoost\": \"0.75\",\r\n                \"style\": \"0\",\r\n                \"useSpeakerBoost\": \"true\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Configuration Priority**\r\n1. Character card settings\r\n2. Environment variables\r\n3. Default values\r\n\r\n**Benefits**\r\n- Consistent voice configuration behavior\r\n- Better character customization support\r\n- Clearer logging of voice selection\r\n- Simplified configuration requirements\r\n- Backward compatibility maintained\r\n- No breaking changes for existing setups\r\n\r\n**Technical Details**\r\n- Updated voice selection to check both VITS and ElevenLabs settings in character cards\r\n- Added comprehensive ElevenLabs configuration support in character cards\r\n- Made all ElevenLabs schema fields optional with sensible defaults\r\n- Maintained backward compatibility with existing environment variables\r\n- Added debug logging to track voice selection process\r\n\r\n**Labels**\r\n- enhancement\r\n- text-to-speech\r\n- configuration\r\n```",

Because it is failing in the install dependencies step and not even getting to the codecov step.\r\n\r\nCan you try to rerun it too?"

If no image provider is specified, the system would continue using the default model provider, maintaining backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nWe've explored using a single provider (such as Heurist or OpenAI) for both text and image generation. While this works adequately, it limits flexibility. For instance, if you want to use a fine-tuned model from a specialized image generation service, this isn't currently possible.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI've implemented a similar solution that allows me to use OpenAI for text generation while leveraging a custom fine-tuned model on fal.ai for image generation.\r\n",

Once this is done, appending new knowledge to profile has no effect as the `processCharacterKnowledge()` method in `/packages/core/src/runtime.ts` breaks out of the knowledge adding loop as soon as it finds a piece of knowledge that already exists in memory.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nAdd a knowledge section to your character, start the character up for the first time. Stop the agent, update the knowledge and restart the agent. Check db.sqlite and you will see that no new knowledge has been added.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI would expect the agent should be able to absorb new knowledge that is added to the character file on each startup.

Specifically, the errors occur because the `Plugin` type does not include a `clients` property.\r\n\r\nThe following errors are observed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/index.ts:206:24 - error TS2339: Property 'clients' does not exist on type 'Plugin'.\r\n\r\n206             if (plugin.clients) {\r\n                           ~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nsrc/index.ts:207:45 - error TS2339: Property 'clients' does not exist on type 'Plugin'.\r\n\r\n207                 for (const client of plugin.clients) {\r\n                                                ~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to originate from an outdated or incorrect type definition for `Plugin`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **To Reproduce**\r\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.\r\n2. Run the following commands:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   pnpm install\r\n   pnpm start --characters=\"characters/character.character.json\"\r\n   ```\r\n3. Observe the TypeScript build errors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Expected behavior**\r\nThe project should successfully build and start without errors. Type definitions for `Plugin` should include the `clients` property, or the code should handle cases where `clients` is not defined.\r\n",

The error message indicates that the better-sqlite3 module was compiled with NODE_MODULE_VERSION 127, while my current Node.js version requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 131.\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\nTry rebuilding the module:\r\npnpm rebuild better-sqlite3\r\n\r\nReinstall the better-sqlite3 module:\r\npnpm uninstall better-sqlite3 && pnpm install better-sqlite3\r\n\r\nEnsure the version of Node.js being used matches the version the module was compiled for.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\nI am using Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage different Node.js versions.\r\nThe project is running in a Linux environment, but my system is dual-booted with Windows. I am using a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment.\r\nExpected Behavior\r\nI expect the server to start successfully, but instead, the error prevents the agent from starting.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "**Problem:**\r\n\r\nOur open-source project is experiencing rapid growth with numerous contributions from our community members. While we have the infrastructure to create releases, we currently face challenges in ensuring that these releases are reliable and stable. The key issues are:\r\n\r\n- **Broken Test Suite:** Our automated tests are failing, which means we cannot confidently verify the stability and functionality of new code changes.\r\n- **Rapid Code Changes:** With many contributors and fast-moving code, it's difficult to track and integrate changes without introducing new bugs.\r\n- **Unreliable Releases:** Without a consistent and dependable release process, we risk distributing versions of our project that may not meet quality standards.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nTo overcome these challenges and establish a reliable release process, we propose the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Prioritize Fixing the Tests:**\r\n   - **Assess and Repair Tests:** Identify all failing tests and determine the causes. Fix broken tests to ensure they accurately reflect code functionality.\r\n   - **Community Involvement:** Encourage contributors to help fix tests by creating specific issues and assigning tasks.\r\n   - Testing issues can be found with the 'testing' label: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atesting\r\n\r\n2. **Establish Continuous Integration (CI):**\r\n   - **Automate Testing:** Set up a CI system to automatically run the test suite on every commit and pull request. For the most part this is already in place but only runs a basic test currently.\r\n   - **Enforce Test Passing:** Configure the CI to block merging of code that doesn't pass all tests, keeping the main branch stable. We currently have these running on every pull request, but it's not a blocking rule.\r\n\r\n3. **Implement a Branching Strategy:**\r\n   - **Use Feature Branches:** Have contributors work on separate branches for new features or fixes to isolate changes. For the most part this is happening already.\r\n   - **Adopt Release Branches:** Create dedicated branches for preparing releases, allowing for final testing and stabilization.\r\n\r\n4. **Define a Release Workflow:**\r\n   - **Release Types:** Clearly define different release types (e.g., alpha, beta, stable) and their purposes.\r\n   - **Semantic Versioning:** Use semantic versioning to communicate the nature of changes in each release.\r\n\r\n5. **Automate the Release Process:**\r\n   - **Automated Builds and Tagging:** Utilize tools to automate the building of releases and tagging of versions.\r\n   - **Generate Release Notes:** Automatically create release notes from commit messages to document changes. This is already in place and is updated when a tag is created through CI: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n6. **Establish Release Criteria:**\r\n   - **Set Clear Requirements:** Define what must be completed before a release (passing tests, code reviews, updated documentation).\r\n   - **Use a Release Checklist:** Implement a checklist to ensure all criteria are met before releasing.\r\n\r\n7. **Enhance Collaboration and Communication:**\r\n   - **Regular Updates:** Hold regular meetings or send updates to keep everyone informed about release progress.\r\n   - **Transparency:** Make the release roadmap and plans accessible to all contributors.\r\n\r\n8. **Implement Code Reviews and Quality Assurance:**\r\n   - **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require that all code changes are reviewed by at least one other contributor. We've talked about this in discord, but it hasn't been implemented as a rule yet.\r\n   - **Use Quality Tools:** Integrate static analysis and other quality assurance tools to catch issues early.\r\n\r\n9. **Plan for Different Release Channels:**\r\n   - **Stable Releases:** Provide thoroughly tested versions for general use.\r\n   - **Beta and Nightly Builds:** Offer less stable versions for testing new features and gathering feedback.\r\n\r\n10. **Monitor and Iterate:**\r\n    - **Collect Feedback:** After each release, gather input from users and contributors to identify improvements.\r\n    - **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly refine the release process based on feedback and performance metrics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Next Steps:**\r\n\r\n- **Immediate Actions:**\r\n  - **Fix the Test Suite:** Prioritize repairing all broken tests with the help of the community.\r\n  - **Set Up CI System:** Implement a continuous integration pipeline to automate testing and enforce code quality.\r\n\r\n- **Community Engagement:**\r\n  - **Communicate Plans:** Share this proposed solution with the community to align efforts and expectations.\r\n  - **Encourage Participation:** Invite contributors to take active roles in improving the testing and release processes.\r\n\r\n- **Documentation:**\r\n  - **Create Guidelines:** Document the release workflow, branching strategy, and contribution guidelines.\r\n  - **Provide Resources:** Offer tutorials or guides on how to work with the new processes and tools.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy taking these steps, we aim to build a robust and reliable release process that can handle rapid development while maintaining high-quality standards. This will not only improve the stability of our releases but also enhance collaboration within our community, ultimately leading to a better project for all users and contributors.",

    "title": "Managing Divergence Across the Eliza Ecosystem (Multiple Forks)",
    "body": "**Description:**\r\n\r\nThe Eliza project is gaining traction, and many developers are forking the repository to create custom agents or specialized implementations. This distributed development model is a strength, but it also creates a challenge: managing code divergence and ensuring interoperability across the growing Eliza ecosystem. This ticket aims to establish a community-driven plan for addressing this challenge, fostering collaboration, and maximizing code reuse while allowing for customization and innovation within individual forks.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\n* **Multiple Diverging Forks:** As more developers fork Eliza, the ecosystem will naturally fragment into various specialized implementations.\r\n* **Increased Merge Complexity:** Merging changes between forks, or between forks and the main repository, will become increasingly complex and error-prone as divergence increases.\r\n* **Maintenance Overhead:**  Each fork incurs its own maintenance burden, requiring developers to track upstream changes, resolve merge conflicts, and ensure compatibility.\r\n* **Duplication of Effort and Reinventing the Wheel:** Developers in different forks might unknowingly duplicate efforts by re-implementing similar features.\r\n* **Reduced Interoperability:**  Divergence can lead to reduced interoperability between different Eliza agents or implementations.\r\n\r\n**Goals:**\r\n\r\n* **Minimize Divergence (Where Feasible):** Encourage practices that minimize unnecessary code divergence across forks.\r\n* **Facilitate Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:** Foster communication and collaboration between maintainers of different forks and the core Eliza team.\r\n* **Streamline Merging and Integration:** Establish best practices and potentially develop tools for efficiently merging changes between forks and the main repository.\r\n* **Maximize Code Reuse:**  Promote modular design and encourage the development of reusable plugins and components that can be shared across the ecosystem.\r\n* **Maintain Core Eliza Stability:**  Ensure that core Eliza functionality remains stable and reliable while allowing for innovation and customization within forks.\r\n\r\n**Near-Term Plan (Community-Driven):**\r\n\r\n1. **Fork Registry (Website or GitHub Page):** Create a central registry of known Eliza forks. This registry could include project descriptions, contact information for maintainers, and links to the forked repositories.  This facilitates discovery and collaboration.\r\n\r\n2. **Communication Channels (Discord, Forum):**  Establish dedicated communication channels (e.g., a Discord server, a forum category) for discussing fork management, sharing best practices, and coordinating development efforts.\r\n\r\n3. **Modularization and Plugin Development:**  Encourage developers to refactor fork-specific code into modular plugins or extensions that can be easily shared and integrated with other Eliza implementations.\r\n\r\n4. **Standardized Plugin Interface:**  Develop and document a clear, standardized interface for creating Eliza plugins.  This promotes interoperability and simplifies plugin integration.\r\n\r\n5. **Shared Test Suite:**  Create a shared test suite that covers core Eliza functionality.  Encourage fork maintainers to incorporate this test suite into their continuous integration pipelines to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n6. **Documentation:**  Create documentation and tutorials on best practices for forking Eliza, managing divergence, and contributing back to the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Future Considerations (Speculative):**\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Merging Tools:**  Explore and potentially develop automated merging tools that can help resolve conflicts and integrate changes between forks more efficiently.\r\n2. **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) Workflows:** Investigate whether alternative version control systems or workflows (like Git submodules or subtree merging) could facilitate managing multiple forks.\r\n3. **Inter-Agent Communication Protocol:** If AI-driven code synchronization is a long-term goal, develop a protocol or language for communication between agents managing different forks.\r\n4. **Federated Learning for Agents:**  Explore the potential of federated learning techniques, allowing agents in different forks to collaboratively train and improve shared models without directly exchanging sensitive data.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n\r\n* A community-driven plan is established and documented for managing divergence across the Eliza ecosystem.\r\n* The plan includes specific steps for facilitating collaboration, streamlining merging, maximizing code reuse, and maintaining core Eliza stability.\r\n* The plan is actively communicated and promoted within the Eliza community.\r\n* Tools and resources (fork registry, communication channels, shared test suite) are created to support the plan's implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ticket expands the scope to address the broader challenge of managing multiple forks within the Eliza ecosystem. The key shift is towards a community-driven approach, emphasizing collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the development of shared resources and standards. This fosters a more vibrant and sustainable ecosystem while allowing individual forks the flexibility to innovate and adapt Eliza to their specific needs.",

    "title": "Feature Request: Automated Bot Registry and Private Communication Protocol",
    "body": "**Summary**: Implement an automated registry and communication system that enables trading bots to discover each other, communicate efficiently, and trade in a secure and private back channel. \r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\nAs the project expands and more instances of the trading bot are forked and installed, there's an opportunity for these bots to be aware of each other's existence and to communicate directly. The goal is to establish a decentralized, automated registry system that allows bots to discover and authenticate each other. Once connected, the bots will communicate through a private back channel to exchange data and execute trades efficiently.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Features**:\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Registry System**: \r\n   - Each bot will register itself in a decentralized registry (e.g., using a lightweight P2P network or distributed ledger technology).\r\n   - Bots will periodically update the registry, checking for new bots or changes in status.\r\n   - The registry will include basic metadata to facilitate discovery, like cryptographic keys for authentication.\r\n   - Possibly services a particular bot provides to other bots that they could pay for in the future. (more on this later)\r\n\r\n2. **Private Back Channel Communication**:\r\n   - Implement a secure, real-time communication protocol, potentially leveraging WebRTC or a similar P2P technology.\r\n   - The protocol should ensure encrypted communication between bots, minimizing the risk of interception.\r\n   - Messages will be designed for minimal latency, suitable for rapid data exchange and trading negotiations.\r\n\r\n3. **Authentication and Security**:\r\n   - Use public-private key cryptography for bot authentication, ensuring only legitimate bots can participate in the network.\r\n   - Establish rules for trust and security, with mechanisms to handle untrusted or malicious bots.\r\n\r\n4. **Efficient Trading Protocol**:\r\n   - Design a protocol that allows bots to share and match order books in a streamlined manner.\r\n   - Ensure trades are executed quickly, with minimal delay, using predefined negotiation rules.\r\n   - Incorporate a fallback mechanism if communication or negotiation fails.\r\n\r\n**Benefits**:\r\n- **Speed**: A dedicated, private communication channel will facilitate faster data exchange compared to public platforms.\r\n- **Security**: Encrypted communication ensures that sensitive trading data remains confidential.\r\n- **Scalability**: The decentralized nature of the registry will support the growth of the network without becoming a bottleneck.\r\n\r\n**Considerations**:\r\n- The system should be resilient to potential attacks, like Sybil attacks, by incorporating strong authentication and trust mechanisms.\r\n- Developing a lightweight and efficient protocol is critical to minimize resource usage and latency.\r\n",

    "title": "getCachedEmbeddings broken for sqlite adapter ",
    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe `getCachedEmbeddings` for the sqlite adapter is flawed with the recent [introduction of vec_distance_L2](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/commit/e96764a53c1d15b6f53cff6ec842f63f70d13842). \r\n\r\n```\r\npackages/adapter-sqlite/src/index.ts:226\r\nconst memories = this.db.prepare(sql).all(opts.query_table_name, new Float32Array(opts.query_input.split(\",\").map(Number)), // Convert string to Float32Array\r\n                                              ^\r\nRangeError: Too few parameter values were provided\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The sql query expects 5 values, but only 4 are passed. `query_match_count` should be used for `LIMIT`\r\n2. The creation of the float array seems off. The `query_input` does not include any comma separated values. The resulting array is `[NaN]`\r\n3. Distance comparison is between a float array and a string. It should probably be compared to `query_threshold`, not `query_input`\r\n\r\nRelated function is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/15f7ba88d04d9d7d1cf0f608762fa84da06cb313/packages/adapter-sqlite/src/index.ts#L332C11-L360\r\n\r\nI'm happy to contribute if someone can guide me. I have little clue about `vec_distance` and didn't manage to infer what the intention of the change was exactly.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"characters/custom.character.json\"` and type something\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nNo sqlite errors\r\n",

Should we make like an AI one? or is this something to do with the docs framework?\n\n## API\n* In general, API docs typically have a standard format that provides the interface, parameters, endpoints, etc. for something like a REST API. So when clicking this, I was not expecting to see setup instructions. It seems like this is mostly duplicate info from the \"[Getting Started](https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/docs/quickstart/)\" section. There isn't really an API, so I'd suggest we just remove this section for now.\n* Possibly replace with with some documentation about how the core information flows from the Agent Runtime, to the Memory System, the Room-based Organization, Information Processing Pipeline, Provider Integration, and State Management - though these could all be valid sections under the Advanced Concepts section as well on the Documentation page.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c6d401-9b6b-4f49-90f7-528ffb4acefb)\n*  banner image is broken\n",

        "body": "Based on the CI errors, there are several issues that need to be addressed. \n\nThe main problems are:\n1. Module resolution and file extensions\n2. Incorrect usage of BigNumber constructor\n3. Incorrect usage of youtube-dl-exec\n4. Missing type definitions\n5. Node version compatibility\n\nHere are the suggested fixes:\n\n1. **Module Resolution Issues**\nThe TypeScript compiler is complaining about missing file extensions in imports when using Node16/NodeNext module resolution. You need to add `.js` extensions to relative imports. For example:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { Something } from '../core/types'\n\n// After\nimport { Something } from '../core/types.js'\n```\n\n2. **BigNumber Construction Issues**\nThere are multiple errors related to BigNumber construction from the bignumber.js package. The correct way to use it is:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nnew BigNumber(value)\n\n// After \nBigNumber(value) // or\nnew BigNumber.BigNumber(value)\n```\n\n3. **YouTube DL Exec Issues**\nThe youtube-dl-exec package is not being called correctly. You need to use its default export:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nyoutubedl(url, options)\n\n// After\nyoutubedl.default(url, options)\n```\n\n4. **PDF.js Types Issue**\nMissing type definitions for pdfjs-dist. Add the types to devDependencies:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/pdfjs-dist\": \"^2.10.378\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere are the specific files that need updates:\n\n1. Update tsconfig.json to handle module resolution:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node16\",\n    \"allowImportingTsExtensions\": true,\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Update CI workflow to use the correct Node version:\n\n```17:20:.github/workflows/ci.yaml\n            - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n              with:\n                  node-version: \"23\"\n                  cache: \"pnpm\"\n```\n\nChange to:\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n  with:\n    node-version: \"22\"\n    cache: \"pnpm\"\n```\n\n3. Add script to fix extensions:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfind src -type f -name \"*.ts\" -exec sed -i 's/from \"\\(\\.\\.?\\/.*\\)\"/from \"\\1.js\"/g' {} +\n```\n\n"

    "body": "Here are effective ways to test a Twitter bot without making live posts:\n\n## Development Environment Testing\n\n**Local Testing**\n- Use a development environment that simulates Twitter's API responses[1]\n- Create test cases that mock Twitter interactions\n- Run your bot offline to verify basic functionality\n\n**API Testing Options**\n- Twitter's API offers no direct sandbox or test mode for posting[5]\n- Consider creating a private test account for development\n\n## Best Practices\n\n**Account Setup**\n- Create a separate development Twitter account specifically for testing\n- Keep the test account private to avoid public visibility\n- Use minimal followers/following to prevent unwanted interactions\n\n**Code Testing Methods**\n- Mock API calls in your code to simulate responses\n- Log bot actions instead of making actual posts\n- Test bot logic and processing separately from the actual posting mechanism\n\n## Bot Detection Testing\n\nBefore deploying, verify your bot behaves naturally by checking against common bot detection criteria:\n\n**Activity Patterns**\n- Maintain reasonable posting frequencies (avoid posting more than 10-15 times per day)[7]\n- Include varied content types, not just retweets\n- Add reasonable delays between actions\n\n**Account Setup**\n- Use a proper profile with complete information[7]\n- Avoid generic or automated-looking usernames\n- Include a proper profile picture and bio\n\nRemember that while testing, you must still comply with Twitter's terms of service and API usage guidelines[4].\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72857417/is-there-any-possibility-in-making-a-twitter-bot-without-using-the-dev-api\n[2] https://social-dog.net/en/trend/p81\n[3] https://circleboom.com/twitter-management-tool/twitter-circle-tool/twitter-bot-checker\n[4] https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/Twitter-Developing-New-Human-Test-to-Combat-Bots/637998/\n[5] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71945400/test-tweet-post-with-twitter-api\n[6] https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/verify/verify-bot-or-not-how-to-check-if-a-twitter-account-is-trying-to-manipulate-you/65-582431225\n[7] https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/irl-how-to-spot-a-bot/\n[8] https://devcommunity.x.com/t/how-to-build-a-twitter-bot-to-reply-to-mentions-basic-or-pro-plan/222232",

        "body": "\r\nYeah I had a similar question about the current approach for `generateObject` in `packages/core/generation.ts`. It looks like we're using a workaround instead of the `{ generateObject }` method from `\"ai\"`, which natively supports Z objects and ensures typing. This could be more reliable than the current method of using `generateText` to generate, parse, and retry until we get the desired output.\r\n\r\nUsing `{ generateObject }` would allow us to eliminate the custom `generateObject` and `generateObjectArray` functions, simplifying the code and leveraging the AI SDK's structured output capabilities. Here’s the code as it stands now:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport async function generateObject({\r\n    runtime,\r\n    context,\r\n    modelClass,\r\n}: {\r\n    runtime: IAgentRuntime;\r\n    context: string;\r\n    modelClass: string;\r\n}): Promise<any> {\r\n    if (!context) {\r\n        elizaLogger.error(\"generateObject context is empty\");\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n    let retryDelay = 1000;\r\n\r\n    while (true) {\r\n        try {\r\n            const response = await generateText({\r\n                runtime,\r\n                context,\r\n                modelClass,\r\n            });\r\n            const parsedResponse = parseJSONObjectFromText(response);\r\n            if (parsedResponse) {\r\n                return parsedResponse;\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (error) {\r\n            elizaLogger.error(\"Error in generateObject:\", error);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, retryDelay));\r\n        retryDelay *= 2;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to replace it with the `generateObject` function provided in the AI SDK, as described below:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n/**\r\nGenerate JSON with any schema for a given prompt using a language model.\r\n\r\nThis function does not stream the output. If you want to stream the output, use `streamObject` instead.\r\n\r\n@returns\r\nA result object that contains the generated object, the finish reason, the token usage, and additional information.\r\n*/\r\ndeclare function generateObject(options: Omit<CallSettings, 'stopSequences'> & Prompt & {\r\n    output: 'no-schema';\r\n    model: LanguageModel;\r\n    mode?: 'json';\r\n    experimental_telemetry?: TelemetrySettings;\r\n    experimental_providerMetadata?: ProviderMetadata;\r\n    _internal?: {\r\n        generateId?: () => string;\r\n        currentDate?: () => Date;\r\n    };\r\n}): Promise<GenerateObjectResult<JSONValue>>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwitching to this method would improve reliability and reduce custom parsing logic. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts!"

    "body": "\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nAfter modifying the character personality in defaultCharacter.ts, the AI responses remain unchanged and continue using the old personality settings in both Discord and Twitter interactions. However, the Twitter post creation functionality correctly reflects the new personality changes.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Navigate to defaultCharacter.ts\r\n2. Modify the character personality settings/prompt\r\n3. Save the changes and restart the application\r\n4. Test interactions on Discord - responses use old personality\r\n5. Test interactions on Twitter - responses use old personality\r\n6. Test Twitter post creation - correctly uses new personality\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n- When defaultCharacter.ts is modified, all AI interactions (Discord responses, Twitter replies, and Twitter posts) should reflect the new personality settings immediately after application restart.\r\n- The character should consistently maintain the new personality across all platforms and interaction types.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<!-- You may want to add screenshots showing:\r\n1. The modified defaultCharacter.ts code\r\n2. Discord responses showing old personality\r\n3. Twitter responses showing old personality\r\n4.

Upgrade to Node.js v21.0.0 or later where Promise.withResolvers() is supported\n1. Use an older version of pdfjs-dist that doesn't use this feature. You can modify your package.json\n1. Create a polyfill for Promise.withResolvers(). You would need to add this before importing pdfjs-dist\n\nI think we should go with option 1."

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe goal of this is to enable someone to run 'npx eliza' and it would start a default local running instance of eliza that they could interact with through chat, using all local models.\r\n\r\nIf the user passes a character file, like --characters=<eliza.json>, then it will load that character file. If the characterfile has secrets in it, it will load all of the secrets, as though they had cloned the repo and run npm run dev -- --characters=<eliza>.json\r\n\r\nThe result of this feature is that I can run `npx @ai16z/eliza` and trial locally, or point to a character file and run an agent (or agents)",

This automation provides several crucial advantages:\r\n\r\n**Risk Reduction**\r\n- Updates are delivered in small, manageable increments rather than large, risky batch updates\r\n- Each update comes with its own [pull request](https://senacor.blog/how-to-renovate-why-and-how-you-should-use-automated-dependency-updates-in-your-software-projects/), making it easier to identify breaking changes\r\n- Security vulnerabilities are addressed more quickly through timely updates\r\n\r\n**Time Savings**\r\n- Eliminates manual dependency checking and updating\r\n- Provides transparency into outdated dependencies without manual tracking\r\n- Automatically creates pull requests with changelog information included\r\n\r\n\r\n**Flexible Configuration**\r\n- Supports automatic merging of updates that pass tests\r\n- Allows grouping of updates to r[educe PR noise](https://docs.renovatebot.com/getting-started/use-cases/)\r\n- Can schedule updates during off-hours to avoid CI resource contention",

You can't blame someone for the bot making a stupidly timed sell if they gave you excellent alpha.\r\n\r\nThe first part is just to collect trades in the orderbook. Then we can analyze the data and come up with a weighting strategy.\r\n\r\nThe second part is calculating trust. I think that we care about a weighting of two things -- 30% how much skin they have in the game and 70% how much they've made in the virtual orderbook.\r\n\r\nThese memecoins are such that you'll pick 10 losers and still 10x your money on the 1 winner, finding the winners and maximizing likelihood of win is critical. One parabolic recommendation can give a user a lot of trust.\r\n\r\nUsers will copytrust each other, so there needs to be value in being the first to shill a ticker. We want to weight this against users just shilling every ticker first to try to game the system with a few 100xes.\r\n\r\nFor the actual execution of trade, we can run this on a loop with a randomized tick. 90% of the time, Marc should not execute a trade, but should wake up and analyze the market. When to trade, what and why are the most complicated parts, but this is more of a quality issue than a possibility issue-- quite easy to make the trade happen at all, but hard to get the right details.\r\n\r\nThe plan is just to get it there, to where its making decent consensus trades, and then we can let the quant guys go nuts on our codebase.\r\n"

So if the token spikes and then goes below the acquisition price for eternity it's not as valuable as one that constantly lives in the green.\r\n- a massive multiplier for someone that suggests both an entry and exit recommendation. e.g. day0 \"buy X\" -> price goes up, day3 \"sell X\" -> price goes down. This suggests some level of intimate knowledge of the token in question.\r\n- a weighting for recommendations that go against common consensus. So if everyone is saying buy zig, there's an incentive to find and suggest zag.\r\n- the simulated trades should happen in a \"gym\" or (Simulated Order Book...SOB) and the person graduates to the actual order book where the trades happen.

We are trying to build a multi-agent simulation, so this is the problem we are trying to solve. Right now we have a shouldRespond handler that determines if the bot should respond, using a cheap model. If so, we respond. It's working pretty well, and it follows our ethos that Elizas are \"real agents\" that strive to mimic human behavior.\r\n\r\nI think it's something more simple and technical, but according to the agents, every other agent should just be a user."
